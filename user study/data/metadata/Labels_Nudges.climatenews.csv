10,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/11/republicans-are-increasingly-antagonistic-toward-experts-heres-why-that-matters/,Republicans are increasingly antagonistic toward experts. Here’s why that matters.,Matt Motta,blog,Politics,Monkey Cage,"Since 2015, according to a new Pew Research Center poll, Republicans’ attitudes toward colleges and universities have become much more negative. The poll found that the number of Republicans who believe colleges have a “positive impact on the way things are going in the country” dropped from 54 percent in 2015 to 36 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, Democrats’ approval held constant at 72 percent. <br><br> Has that affected our politics? Several commentators have been asking that question: Has the right’s declining trust in academics, scientists and other experts — call it “anti-intellectualism” — influenced opinions about politics? <br><br> That’s what my new research looks into. Drawing on more than 40 years of survey data, I found that the answer is yes. You can find the new anti-intellectualism in the way candidates and political movements scoff at experts and their evidence — something we can see in public attitudes like the refusal to acknowledge human-caused climate change and support for politicians like Donald Trump. <br><br> A certain kind of populism distrusts intellectuals and experts <br><br> The historian Richard Hofstadter famously referred to Americans’ distrust and dislike of experts as a form of “anti-intellectualism.” Anti-intellectualism has been increasing in the United States since the mid-1990s, primarily among ideological conservatives, according to recent research. <br><br> Throughout U.S. history, politicians have attempted to capitalize on voters’ anti-intellectual attitudes. George Wallace, for example, frequently referred to college professors and judges as “pointy-headed intellectuals” during his third-party campaign for president in 1968. <br><br> More recently, Trump was regularly skeptical of and sometimes openly derisive toward experts a during  his 2016 presidential campaign. Brexit campaigners were similarly skeptical about European Union bureaucrats, even throwing Trump’s famous “You’re fired!” catchphrase at European economists. <br><br> How I did this research <br><br> Does such antagonism toward the experts win over the citizens who hold anti-intellectual attitudes? To answer this question, I analyzed four decades of survey data from two sources. <br><br> One is the General Social Survey (GSS), a representative sample of Americans that has been conducted roughly once every two years since 1972. I measured anti-intellectualism in this survey using a question that asked respondents whether they place a great deal, only some, or hardly any trust in the “scientific community.” <br><br> During the 1990s, conservatives started to distrust experts <br><br> From the early 1970s through early 1990s, I found little ideological divide on this question. In 1991, for example, 47 percent of liberals and 46 percent of conservatives expressed high levels of trust in the scientific community. By the mid-1990s, however, views began to diverge. In 2014, 53 percent of liberals and only 36 percent of conservatives held high levels of trust in the scientific community. <br><br> The second source is a four-wave national panel study collected during the 2016 general election by the University of Minnesota’s Center for the Study of Political Psychology (CSPP), via Survey Sampling International. I measured anti-intellectualism in this survey using a question developed by Eric Oliver and Wendy Rahn. They asked more than 3,500 respondents how much they agreed or disagreed with this statement: “I would rather place my trust in the opinions of ordinary people than the opinions of experts and intellectuals.” <br><br> Here, too, I found significant differences between liberals and conservatives. In 2016, liberals earned an average score of 2.14 on the 0 to 4 point scale — in which zero meant strongly disagreeing that the opinions of ordinary people should be trusted over experts, and four meant strongly agreeing with that statement — while conservatives averaged about 2.42. The difference between the groups is a statistically significant 9 percent. <br><br> In each dataset, I assess the relationship between anti-intellectualism and the public’s political opinions using regression modeling. These models control for several other factors that might influence respondents’ political attitudes, such as partisanship, education and other basic demographics. <br><br> Anti-intellectual Americans were more likely to prefer anti-expert politicians like Wallace or Trump  <br><br> Respondents who were more anti-intellectual were more likely to support candidates who spoke skeptically about experts. In the 1972 GSS, approximately 22 percent of those who “hardly trusted” the scientific community were likely to vote for George Wallace in 1968, compared with only 12 percent of those who placed “a great deal” of trust in experts. <br><br> I found a similar pattern among those who supported or opposed Donald Trump. In the CSPP study, respondents rated Trump and Hillary Clinton on scales ranging from 0 (very negative feelings toward a candidate) to 100 (very positive feelings). The difference between these two scales is known as a “comparative candidate evaluation,” or CCE, which I scaled to range from 0 (favoring Clinton over Trump) to 1 (favoring Trump over Clinton). <br><br> In July, those who strongly felt that expert opinions were less trustworthy than ordinary people’s were more likely to prefer Trump, with an average 0.49 CCE rating; those who strongly disagreed that experts were less trustworthy than ordinary people were more likely to prefer Clinton, with a 0.44 CCE rating. That’s about a 5 percentage-point difference between groups — and it grew to about 8 points among those questioned in in October, with 0.51 and 0.43 CCE, respectively. <br><br> Does being wary of experts lead people to support Trump, or does supporting Trump lead people to be wary of experts? Because the CSPP data interviewed the same respondents a number of times over the course of the election, I was able to use more complex statistical procedures to investigate whether anti-intellectual attitudes increased support for Trump, or vice versa. I found that that anti-intellectual attitudes led voters to support Trump, and not the other way around. <br><br> Attacking science, experts and professors can help get politicians elected <br><br> Anti-intellectualism may influence how politicians campaign in upcoming election cycles. My research shows that politicians can successfully earn support by calling into question not only scientific consensus, but those who produce it. Attacking scientists, college professors and other experts can be a politically useful strategy for those hoping to win over the support of people who hold anti-intellectual attitudes. <br><br> And elections, of course, have consequences. If politicians who deride experts win political office, they may take action consistent with those views once elected. For example, Trump did dismiss EPA science advisers and pull out of the Paris climate agreement — which may increase global carbon emissions, and also help win support on the 2020 campaign trail. <br><br> Matt Motta is a PhD candidate at the University of Minnesota.

But Trump said they should ask the question again if the Senate leader doesn’t deliver on the president’s leading priorities. Besides a health-care bill, those include tax cuts and new infrastructure spending. <br><br> One of the Fox News stories amplified by Trump on Twitter on Friday notes that two GOP senators who’ve spoken out against Trump and his policies — Sen. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Dean Heller (Nev.) — have now drawn primary challenges. <br><br> “Republican senators who have been a thorn in President Trump's side are beginning to see the political consequences of opposing the White House as pro-Trump activists start to mobilize,” says the story retweeted by the president. <br><br> In the wake of Trump’s comments on Thursday, several Republicans said his words could instead backfire, making it more difficult to get his agenda passed on Capitol Hill, where McConnell is a key figure and still popular among fellow GOP senators. So far, Republicans have achieved few major legislative victories, despite control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. <br><br>",11/08/2017,6:44:07,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/11/National-Politics/Images/2017-08-10T203022Z_1530187075_RC11CC1CDC60_RTRMADP_3_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES-TRUMP.jpg,"President Trump speaks to reporters at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, N.J., on Thursday.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) mentioned President Trump during a Saturday morning speech, the more than 1,000 activists at the progressive Netroots Nation conference booed. <br><br> But when she mentioned a “so-called Democratic strategist” who wanted her party to move to the center, the boos rang even louder. <br><br> “Apparently, the path forward is to go back to locking up nonviolent drug offenders and ripping more holes in our economic safety net,” Warren said sarcastically, in a Saturday morning speech. “We’re not going back to the days when universal health care was something Democrats talked about on the campaign trail but were too chicken to fight for after they got elected.” <br><br> Warren’s party, locked out of power in Washington and most of the country, has spent 2017 opposing Trump while also fighting about what it really stands for. Both trends were on display at Netroots, as huddles over how to block Republican bills alternated with protests of Democrats who were seen to be belittling black candidates, LGBT rights or Native Americans. <br><br> The evidence from Atlanta suggested that Democrats might march into 2017 and 2018 elections still arguing about how to win — without dividing the party. <br><br> The high-profile problems of the Democratic National Committee were part of that discussion, but the larger focus was about what progressives were building outside the party, untainted by the Democratic brand. Just as the tea party complemented the work of the Obama-era GOP, progressives want to build organizations, national and hyperlocal, to turn out voters who might be turned off by Democrats. <br><br> “Ninety percent of Americans think that the Republicans put corporations ahead of American citizens, and 80 percent say that the Democratic Party does,” said Tom Steyer, whose political advocacy group NextGen America had already budgeted $8 million for 2018 election turnout operations. “For people under the age of 30, I’ve seen data on how 44 percent of them thought there was no difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on the issues. I mean, that's insane.” <br><br> The 12th annual Netroots Nation conference, which was the first to immediately follow a Democratic loss in a presidential election, revealed the scope of what Barack Obama’s White House once deemed “the professional left.” The Working Families Party, which began in New York and grew across the Northeast and Midwest, announced new state chapters. Activists organized under the Indivisible handbook, a guide created by former congressional staffers with advice on how to pressure their bosses, taught short sessions on how they organized rural campaigns — some which lost, all of which would continue into 2018. <br><br> MoveOn.org, fresh off organizing protests to save the Affordable Care Act from repeal, was promoting a “Resistance Summer” in which thousands of activists would talk to their neighbors about progressive politics. Our Revolution, the group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) after his 2016 presidential bid, promoted its own “Summer of Progress” — activists getting congressional Democrats on record behind eight left-wing bills designed to ease voter registration, create universal health insurance, raise the minimum wage to $15, and reform the criminal justice system. <br><br> The Democrats who came to Atlanta to meet potential supporters often had more positive things to say about the activists than about their party. Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee now running for governor of Florida, framed his own campaign as a challenge to an establishment that seemed to specialize in losing elections. <br><br> “A lot of people are hugely suspect of the organized party, and they question whether or not the will of the people will truly be felt without the influence of party poobahs,” Gillum said. “In the past, those leaders galvanized, they chose, they cleared the field, and our voters weren’t on the same page as them. The fate we suffered was 20 years of Republican leadership in Florida.” <br><br> The Democratic National Committee itself had a minor presence at the conference. DNC Vice Chairman Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota who lost a progressive-backed bid for chairman, was on hand to defend the party’s 2016 platform and its “Better Deal” economic policies. <br><br> It was not an easy sell. At a Friday panel, Ellison visibly sighed when one activist lectured him on why she had joined the Green Party after Sanders’s defeat, and after a Native American activist said his use of the term “nation of immigrants” had been offensive. Ellison’s advice was not to defend the Democrats but to influence them from the grass roots until the party changed. <br><br> “It’s not moral, and it’s not just, but it’s reality,” Ellison said. <br><br> The DNC also dispatched Raffi Krikorian, the party’s new chief technological officer, who arrived this year from Uber and Twitter. He told activists that the DNC’s innovations and data would be more available than under the old regime. For some, however, the DNC was an afterthought; asked about the DNC’s data operation, Steyer of NextGen laughed and said the organization had its own, superior analytics for turning out votes. <br><br> Candidates from Georgia and elsewhere, who had watched their parties collapse in the final years of the Obama presidency, often sounded a lot like Steyer. In a Politico column that ran shortly before the conference, former Sanders digital fundraising manager Michael Whitney suggested that the DNC faced a donor crisis. Despite bear-hugging the “resistance” movement, the DNC had raised just half as much money as the Republican National Committee in 2017 — $38 million to $75 million — and lagged almost as badly among donors giving less than $200 apiece. <br><br> “Republicans have quietly taken a decisive edge over Democrats when it comes to small-dollar fundraising,” wrote Whitney. <br><br> At Netroots, there was little worry about Democratic fundraising, apart from the structural advantage that wealthy donors earned from the 2010 Citizens United decision. <br><br> The metric on which they focused: donations to individual campaigns. Randy Bryce, an ironworker running against House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said that more than 28,000 people had donated to his bid since it began in June. Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams, a candidate for governor, emphasized the work she had done through the New Georgia Project, a third-party group, to register voters. <br><br> “Because we’ve been under Republican control for so long, we do not have the robust infrastructure that other states have,” said Abrams of the Georgia effort. “The competition existed much more acutely when we [Democrats] had more resources. We’ll come together; there are much more skirmishes than actual battles.” <br><br> Not all battles were created equal. There was almost no discussion about the party’s potential candidates in the 2020 presidential election; when Warren made a reference to putting a woman in the Oval Office, the cheers of “Run, Warren, Run” were scattered and brief. <br><br> At a panel on what 2017’s special elections had taught Democrats about the upcoming midterms, defeated Georgia candidate Jon Ossoff repeatedly criticized the “hot take” media culture for suggesting that arguments about policy were holding Democrats back. <br><br> “Get offline and go knock on doors,” Ossoff said. “Democrats are united, no matter what you hear on cable news or in the hot takes … we don’t have to beat ourselves up over the fact that there’s a range of views and strategies. Let’s get on with it, and take back the House.” <br><br>",12/08/2017,16:52:32,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/12/Others/Images/2017-08-12/170812_wp_netroots_1369.jpg,Mikey Franklin of the District wears a custom shirt he had made at the Netroots Nation conference in Atlanta on Saturday.

That decision means alienating conservatives who have demanded spending cuts, likely forcing leaders to turn to Democrats to deliver the votes necessary to avoid default. That option may be the safest way to avoid economic fallout from the United States’ failure to pay its bills. But it also risks angering conservatives who view the decision as an unacceptable violation of a core political promise to cut spending. <br><br> For months, conservatives have said that they are willing to negotiate modest spending cuts that could be considered alongside the inevitable debt-limit increase. But those talks never began in earnest. Instead, GOP lawmakers have been reluctant to identify any specific cuts they believe could get the support of a majority of Republicans. <br><br> Instead, many Republicans have speculated that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will work with Democrats on a package that could tie the debt limit to other bipartisan legislation, such as extending health-care coverage for low-income children. The idea has conservatives fuming. <br><br> “It’s sort of absurd to think that there are not more domestic discretionary cuts that couldn’t happen, but there isn’t the political will do to that,” said Dan Holler, vice president of the conservative group Heritage Action. <br><br> “It’s also the type of scenario where conservatives typically lose out,” Holler said. “Conservatives should not be on the losing end in such a traumatic way with a Republican president. I think it’s a real test of this Congress.” <br><br> Holler and other conservatives worry that the debt limit will be one of several conservative losses next month, when Congress faces a number of pressing deadlines, including the one Sept. 29 to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. Many Republicans privately admit that they expect GOP leaders will rely on Democrats to pass a spending bill, as well. <br><br> Republican leaders were forced to turn to Democrats to pass a $1.1 trillion spending deal to avert a government shutdown in May after conservatives refused to support it. At the time, leaders said they would spend the next several months developing a budget that would increase military spending, cut domestic costs and reduce the federal deficit. But none of those plans have been realized. <br><br> Instead, Congress was focused on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Republicans viewed repealing the ACA as a critical first step in a dramatic overhaul of government spending by making permanent steps to rein in entitlement programs like Medicaid. But throughout the process Republicans struggled to back the plan, which would have gutted Medicaid and cut spending on a number of widely used health-care programs. <br><br> Ultimately, those fears are what killed the legislation, representing the clearest sign yet that some Republicans were not prepared to follow through on promises to cut spending. <br><br> Steve Bell, a former staff director for the Senate Budget Committee, said federal spending on domestic programs has been constrained for years and many of the remaining expenditures are on popular programs that even many conservatives don’t want to touch for fear of angering voters. <br><br> “The deficit hawks have been routed,” Bell said. “They will not touch Medicare, Medicaid nor Social Security despite recent warnings from the trustees, despite the absolute undeniable facts. As long as they shy away from that, all the rest of that is bluster and messaging.” <br><br> The White House has signaled that it doesn’t want to risk the possibility of another standoff when it comes to increasing the debt limit. Last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told members of the House Financial Services Committee that the White House would not push for spending cuts and would support a “clean” debt-limit increase. <br><br> “There should be very strict controls of spending money, but once we’ve agreed to spend the money, we should make sure that the government can pay for it,” Mnuchin said. <br><br> There had been concerns that Mnuchin might be at odds with other factions within the White House who were privately pushing President Trump to demand cuts and flirting with the idea of selectively paying off debts beyond September. Mnuchin dismissed that talk, saying his view represented the entire White House. <br><br> Congressional leaders have repeatedly vowed to address the debt limit soon after they return from August recess. In the House, members have 12 legislative days to pass the increase and nearly half a dozen other must-pass priorities like the spending bills — all deadlines Ryan has vowed to meet. <br><br> “House Republicans are discussing with the Senate and the administration, and we will act before the deadline,” said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. <br><br> Still, conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus say they want to work with Ryan on a plan to buck White House guidance and add modest spending cuts to a debt-limit vote. <br><br> Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and others have called on Ryan to cancel a planned mid-September break to stay in Washington and work out a plan for spending cuts. Jordan said the House has barely touched on the debt limit and members haven’t had a chance to see if a deal can be reached. <br><br> “I think there could be the votes there, but we haven’t explored that. We all went home,” Jordan said in an interview. “When you go home you don’t discuss it, but then say you don’t have the votes. You didn’t even try.” <br><br> That lack of effort has been a frustration for many conservatives who worry they will be alienated from the negotiations, despite promises that leaders would pursue a deeply conservative agenda this year. Rep. Thomas Garrett (R-Va.) said Republicans should be held accountable for promises they made while campaigning, including passing spending cuts, even when they’re difficult. <br><br> “We didn’t put a clean debt- limit increase in front of [President Barack] Obama. Why would we do it now?” Garrett said in an interview. “The ‘I-don’t-want-to-do-anything-unpopular’ disease affects both parties.” <br><br>",12/08/2017,13:48:35,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/12/National-Politics/Images/Tea_Party_Rally_74441-8518a-4743.jpg,"Rep.

Not so fast.,Dan Balz,article,Politics,Politics,"President Trump’s approval rating is at 38 percent. His base is said to be eroding. Average approval of the Republican-controlled Congress is at 16 percent. And the president is at war with his party’s leaders. For Democrats, what’s not to like? The answer isn’t as obvious as it might sound. <br><br> Trump and the Republicans have concluded one of the least productive first six months of a new presidency. No signature piece of legislation has reached the president’s desk, and the notable failure to enact a health-care bill stands as an indictment against both the president and GOP congressional leaders. <br><br> That’s not to say Trump hasn’t had successes. On some fronts, particularly the regulatory rollback that he and Republicans have promised, the president has made progress. He has followed through on his pledge to crack down on illegal immigration (and now even legal immigration). The toughened policies appease his supporters and alarm his opponents. In other areas, trade for example, his presidency has been more bold talk than vigorous action. <br><br> With each presidential stumble or controversy, Democrats look to 2018 and anticipate significant gains. They are virtually guaranteed to pick up seats in the House, given the history of midterm elections. The question is how many. A tidal wave of opposition to a Republican president, like that of 2006, could sweep Republicans out of power in the House. But is that in the offing? <br><br> Democrats see evidence in polls and focus groups of an electorate receptive to moving in their direction. They see energy in the number of candidates willing to step forward and run for office. They are confident that the anger that put so many people on the streets early in Trump’s presidency will carry forward to the ballot box 15 months from now, although evidence about enthusiasm among Democrats and Republicans offers a mixed picture. <br><br> But there are other factors that could frustrate the Democrats, from the state of the economy to obstacles created by structural aspects of a polarized electorate to the peculiar ways in which the president defies or at least confounds some traditional measures of public opinion. <br><br> It is remarkable that the president’s average approval rating is below 40 percent at a time when the unemployment rate is at a 16-year low and the stocks have hit record highs this summer, at least until jittery markets reacted to warnings by the president of possible military conflict with North Korea. <br><br> The economy is not soaring, as the president often suggests. But it remains on the path of steady, if slow, growth that marked the Obama years. The benefits of growth remain uneven; many Americans either don’t see bigger paychecks or don’t feel they are getting ahead. Trump promises even more robust growth, a pledge that could be difficult to fulfill. <br><br> Democratic strategists are aware of the mismatch between the president’s approval and the state of the economy and hope that the midterm elections will be simply a referendum on the president, as first midterms often are. But if there is no significant economic retrenchment over the coming year, the head winds buffeting Republicans could be reduced. <br><br> The president’s approval is lower than any past president after 200-plus days in office, a few points lower than former president Bill Clinton’s was at this point in his presidency. Clinton saw his party lose control of the House in 1994. <br><br> Democrats hope to see a replay of the 2006 midterm, when they took advantage of dissatisfaction with President George W. Bush to regain control of the House. But between 2006 and today, something important happened. The shape of congressional districts changed and changed in the direction of the Republicans. <br><br>",12/08/2017,10:33:00,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/11/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Democrats_Message_88205-a1e4b-2430.jpg,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks last month in Berryville, Va., to unveil the Democrats’ new agenda.

Trump has mocked McConnell and his lieutenants on social media for abandoning the health-care effort. Coupled with Trump’s recent attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the rift between the president and Senate Republicans is growing. <br><br> Now the question is whether Democrats can seize on these moments and extract actual results in putting up barriers between Trump, the Justice Department and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. <br><br> So far, Democrats have devoted most of their time to forging a new policy agenda to show voters next year what they would do if given power. They want voters to know the party would do more than just investigate Trump and focus on scandals. <br><br> That focus has left a void in their messaging regarding the Russia investigation. It sometimes leads to a cacophony of voices and ideas shouted into the winds of the Internet every time there’s a new revelation about Trump’s campaign and ties to Russia. <br><br> Some Democrats want to forge a broad bipartisan coalition to put the brakes on Trump, even if it means setting aside policy disputes for the time being. <br><br> “We’re going to need a temporary alliance of progressives and conservatives to save the country, and then we can get back to fighting over the size and scope of the government,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in an interview before Congress left earlier this month for the August recess. “This is a national emergency, and we’re going to have to lay down our arms on some of these public-policy issues long enough to reassert that there are, in fact, three separate, coequal branches of government and we are a country of laws and not men.” <br><br> But others suggest that investigations by Mueller and the House and Senate intelligence committees are well underway and that Democrats need patience. <br><br> “We’re seriously into it, and I have to say that the Republicans, they’re not obstructing anymore. They are all moving forward and they all understand how serious this is,” said Sen. Angus King (Maine), an independent who caucuses with the Democrats and serves on the intelligence panel. <br><br> This Democratic dilemma was captured the night that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) posted an excerpt from his new book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” criticizing congressional Republican leaders for not forcefully confronting Trump during the 2016 campaign. <br><br> Three top Democratic strategists reacted completely differently to the Arizona Republican’s criticism of his own party. “Brave and well argued. I hope both sides have his back,” Robby Mook, the 2016 campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, tweeted. <br><br> “I’m much more concerned with his actual voting record. Writing a column is a lot easier than voting against TrumpCare,” Guy Cecil, head of the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA, tweeted. <br><br> Brian Fallon, a top press aide in the Clinton campaign, called the Flake book the equivalent of “just a bunch” of tweets “[u]ntil it is matched by any real action.” <br><br> For now, there has been little to no effort by Democrats to define “any real action.” Do they expect Republicans to vote against Trump’s policy positions because of the shadow of the Russia investigation? Do they want to push for impeachment proceedings? Do they want Republicans to join Flake in a chorus of Trump criticism? <br><br> Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wants Republicans to start backing up their critiques of Trump with legislative action. <br><br> After Trump tried to implement an entry ban affecting several majority-Muslim nations, Murphy introduced legislation to block the executive order and hoped for bipartisan support, given how many Republicans criticized Trump’s call for such a ban during the presidential campaign. <br><br> “I heard a lot of Republicans vigorously complain about the Muslim ban, but none of them were willing to move legislation to stop it,” Murphy said. <br><br> He applauded Republicans for joining Democrats in approving new sanctions against Russia, overwhelmingly passing legislation that also tied Trump’s hands if he tried to waive those penalties. <br><br> A good first step for Democrats might be pressuring more Republicans to support proposed legislation that would restrict a president’s ability to fire a special counsel, considering two high-profile Republicans are already supporting such an effort. <br><br> Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have each joined Democrats to offer bills that would require a panel of judges to sign off on the firing of Mueller or any special counsel. This would limit the president’s and the attorney general’s ability to shut down the investigation. <br><br> Given Senate Republicans’ current feelings toward Trump, Democrats might be able to get many Republicans to sign on to one or both bills, sending a warning shot at the president. <br><br> Schatz said those are the sort of actions that he is looking for in Republicans, hoping that more of them would publicly declare that “one of the bright lines” that Trump cannot cross would be firing Sessions or Mueller. <br><br> Schatz, firmly in his caucus’s liberal wing, dismissed his allies who are critical of Republicans for continuing to vote in a conservative direction. He does not expect Republicans to start opposing conservative legislation or nominees such as Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch just because Trump is president. <br><br> “That’s a misunderstanding of who Jeff Flake is; he’s a conservative,” Schatz said. “We can’t expect them to become Democrats, but we want them to be small-R republicans, and we need them to help the president understand what the boundaries are in a republic.” <br><br>",12/08/2017,11:49:03,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/12/National-Politics/Images/Botsford170606Trump16287-4730.JPG,"President Donald Trump speaks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, left, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, right, during a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, June 06, 2017.

4,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/14/elizabeth-warrens-advice-for-democrats-dont-fall-back-to-the-center/,Elizabeth Warren’s advice for Democrats: Don’t fall back to the center,David Weigel,blog,Politics,PowerPost,"On Saturday morning, as the nation’s attention turned to the white supremacist march in Charlottesville and its violent aftermath, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) used a speech at the progressive Netroots Nation convention to lay down a marker for the Democratic Party’s future. <br><br> There was little buzz in the room about the 2020 presidential primaries — shouts of “Run Warren Run” and “Warren 2020″ were short and muted. But Warren, one of the party’s most popular figures, told activists that they could safely ignore any advice about how Democrats could win only through moderation. <br><br> Here are four points that we’re probably going to hear more about as the left wages and mostly wins battles inside the party. <br><br> No fear of “identity politics.” Near the top of her remarks, Warren ridiculed — by name — a New York Times op-ed in which pollster Mark Penn and disgraced politician Andrew Stein beseeched Democrats to “move to the center and reject the siren calls of the left.” This, according to Warren, not-so-subtly suggested that the party needed to pander to white voters at the expense of non-whites. <br><br> “Apparently, the path forward is to go back to locking up non-violent drug offenders and ripping more holes in our economic safety net,” Warren said. Later, she counted off a series of issues where Democrats decisively took the side of black activists. The “system is rigged,” she said… <br><br> … when the black-white wealth gap triples over the past three decades. When racist voter ID laws and voter suppression tactics sprout like weeds all across the country. When a man too racist to become a judge in the 1980s now runs the Department of Justice. When communities like Flint are living with poisoned water and polluted air. When there’s still no justice for, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Philando Castile and so many more. <br><br> Warren’s opposition to Attorney General Jeff Sessions was already famous, especially on the left, but it was striking that she called him a racist — and she did so to applause. <br><br> Defining the “bad” donors. Warren, who has repeatedly criticized her party’s 2016 presidential campaign messaging, included one pointed line: “We’re not going back to the days when a Democrat who wanted to run for a seat in Washington first had to grovel on Wall Street.” It was impossible to hear that line and not think of how Hillary Clinton’s campaign, especially after the primary against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), never shook off the stigma of “Wall Street money.” <br><br> But Warren, who represents Martha’s Vineyard and other bastions of big Democratic money, defined the bad sort of donations narrowly. That reframed the kind of argument that broke out after Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) met with “Clinton donors.” It would be impossible to fund Democratic campaigns without most of the people who backed Clinton; it is possible, and likely a good frame for 2018 and 2020, to noisily reject financial industry money. <br><br> Labor rights as civil rights. Warren suggested that Democrats needed to get behind basically every priority of the labor movement, and make it easier to join a union, a cause that was stymied in 2010 when Democrats lost the supermajority that could have passed the Employee Free Choice (or card check) bill. <br><br> “We’re going to fight for fully portable benefits for everyone,” said Warren, “and we’re going to fight to make sure that all work — full-time, part-time, gig — carries basic, pro-rata benefits. We’re going to fight to make it easier for workers to come together to form a union so they can take power into their own hands. And we’re going to turn the minimum wage into a living wage. Fight for $15!” <br><br> Single-payer health care as a 2020 standard. The arguments between Democrats about whether every 2018 candidate should back single-payer health care are happening, in part, because single-payer is becoming a de facto Democratic position in 2020. Every Senate Democrat seen as a potential candidate, from Warren to Harris to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), now backs “Medicare for All.” Even Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who launched the first 2020 bid this month to — let’s be honest — an avalanche of skepticism, has said he’s “for single-payer evolving from the context of the market we have now.” <br><br> Warren used her speech to reiterate her support for expanding Social Security payments, and to make single-payer the party’s default health-care pitch. “It’s not enough just to defend the Affordable Care Act, we’re going to improve it, starting with bringing down the costs of prescription drugs — and leading the fight for Medicare for all,” she said. <br><br> The whole speech is below. <br><br> Before I begin, I would like to say a word about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program – DACA – that was just discussed. <br><br> The fights that we fight for – they matter. In 2012 — because of persistence of many of you in this room – 800,000 young men and women were protected from deportation. <br><br> Because of DACA, DREAMers, who are as American as you and me, were promised a chance. The chance to work. The chance to live without the fear of being ripped away from the only home most of them have ever known. The chance to build a future. <br><br> Now, President Trump will make a decision on DACA. DREAMers’ future hangs in the balance. This Tuesday, August 15, people are mobilizing to protect DREAMers. Let’s not sit back. Let’s stand together to say: President Trump, let DREAMers stay. They are our friends, our family, our future. Give DREAMers the chance to build their dreams. <br><br> These fights matter. These fights matter, and that’s why it’s good to be back at Netroots Nation! <br><br> Thank you Mary, thank you Eric, thank you Arshad, and thank you to the entire Netroots Nation team for bringing us together again. And what a treat it is to be here in Atlanta – the hometown of a man who has taught us the importance of necessary trouble, my friend and hero John Lewis. <br><br> I look out here and see 3000 progressives, people of every race, gender, religion, and color, all committed to building a better future. I look out here and I see Donald Trump’s worst nightmare. <br><br> Yes, Trump’s worst nightmare, but also a big threat to everyone who kind of likes things the way they work now. A few weeks ago, I saw an op-ed in the New York Times from a so-called Democratic strategist titled, “Back to the Center, Democrats.” <br><br> It was all about how we have to stop caring about, quote, “identity politics” and stop waging, quote, “class warfare.” Apparently, the path forward is to go back to locking up non-violent drug offenders and ripping more holes in our economic safety net. <br><br> I even got a shoutout! Apparently, I’m the face of the problem. So is Bernie. But let’s be really clear here – the real power, the real threat, is not me — it’s you, all of you. It’s your energy, your passion, and your commitment to our values that threaten the bland, business-as-usual establishment. <br><br> We’ve been warned off before. Give up, keep your heads down, be realistic, act like a grown-up, keep doing the same old same old. <br><br> But here’s what’s interesting: instead of lots of lots of ferocious back-and-forth and piling on, this time, no one cared. Big yawn. Why? Because the Democratic Party isn’t going back to the days of welfare reform and the crime bill. It is NOT going to happen. <br><br> We’re not going back to the days of being lukewarm on choice. <br><br> We’re not going back to the days when universal health care was something Democrats talked about on the campaign trail but were too chicken to fight for after they got elected. <br><br> And we’re not going back to the days when a Democrat who wanted to run for a seat in Washington first had to grovel on Wall Street. <br><br> Democrats are heading forward. We are looking ahead – and we will not, we shall not, we must not allow anyone to turn back the clock. <br><br> A lot of you have been coming since the very first YearlyKos in 2006. That feels like a long, long time ago. Way back in 2006 and still when I first started coming in 2010, a big part of what we were trying to do was to “crash the gate” and get the Democratic Party to listen to us. <br><br> We wanted a party led by people who weren’t afraid to call themselves progressives. <br><br> We wanted a party that would defend progressive values. <br><br> We wanted a chance to fight for progressive solutions to our nation’s challenges. <br><br> We wanted a movement. And now, look around. We got the progressive movement, and we gather here every year to organize, to energize, and to sing karaoke. <br><br> And now? <br><br> We are not the gate crashers of today’s Democratic Party. <br><br> We are not a wing of today’s Democratic Party. <br><br> We are the heart and soul of today’s Democratic Party. <br><br> But, boy, we’ve inherited a hell of a challenge, haven’t we? <br><br> We’re gathering here in Atlanta in a moment of crisis for our country. And I’m not just talking about Donald Trump and his Twitter account. More and more working families today are hanging on by their fingernails in a country with an economy and a government that works only for those at the very top. <br><br> This crisis didn’t start when Donald Trump walked into the Oval Office. And it won’t just magically disappear the day he walks out of it. <br><br> Me, I’ve been shouting about this crisis from every rooftop I could find for years – talking about how our middle class was squeezed to the breaking point, how chances to move up in this economy were disappearing, and warning that, if we weren’t careful, the very promise of this nation — the commitment to expand opportunities — would be lost. <br><br> That’s the fight that got me into politics. That’s the fight that brought me to my very first Netroots all those years ago. <br><br> How about you? By applause: Who got into the fight because they were passionate about economic justice? Who came to fight for reproductive rights? How about clean air and clean water? How about immigration? Civil rights? Human rights? Anti-war? Campaign finance reform? Net neutrality? Any other bankruptcy nerds in the house? <br><br> That’s one of the things I love about coming to Netroots. We all came to this fight from different experiences. We all get fired up about different issues. <br><br> But if we’re going to be the people who lead the Democratic Party back from the wilderness and lead our country out of this dark time, then we can’t waste energy arguing about whose issue matters most or who in our alliance should be voted off the island. <br><br> We need to see each other’s fights as our own. And I believe we can. <br><br> In the wake of the last election, I’ve heard people say we need to decide whether we’re the party of the white working class or the party of Black Lives Matter. <br><br> I say we can care about a dad who’s worried that his kid will have to move away from their factory town to find good work – and we can care about a mom who’s worried that her kid will get shot during a traffic stop. <br><br> The way I see it, those two parents have something deep down in common — the system is rigged against both of them — and against their kids. <br><br> Over the last generation, the most powerful people in this country have gotten way more powerful. Corporate profits and CEO pay are near record highs. But workers’ wages haven’t budged, and, one after another, workers’ rights are getting wiped away. Unions are under attack. Millions of people are struggling to piece together two, three, or four jobs just to pay the rent. <br><br> The balance of power is shifting in other parts of our economy, too. In industry after industry – airlines, banking, health care, agriculture, tech – a handful of corporate giants control more and more and more. The big guys are locking out smaller, newer competitors. They are crushing innovation. Even if you don’t see the gears turning, this massive consolidation means prices go up and quality goes down for everything from air travel to broadband service. Rural America is left behind, dismissed by corporate giants as fly-over country. <br><br> This concentration of power strikes at the heart of our democracy. Our government is supposed to be the one place where everybody gets the same fair shot, no matter how powerful or powerless they might be. But thanks to the revolving door between Capitol Hill, K Street and Wall Street, powerful people have more and more influence in Congress. Thanks to Citizens United, corporate money slithers through Washington like a snake. Washington works great for the rich and powerful, but for everyone else, not so much. <br><br> Yes, the system is rigged – and if you don’t feel like anyone in politics is doing anything to un-rig it, well, that’s how a lot of folks who should have been with us last November wound up voting for Donald Trump. <br><br> For many Americans, it isn’t news that the balance of power in our country has seriously tilted away from them. African Americans. LGBTQ Americans. Immigrants. Muslims. Women. Poor people. <br><br> No, I have not personally experienced the fear, the oppression, and the pain that many of my fellow Americans endure every day. But I do know this: For a lot of our fellow citizens, the system is rigged now and it has been rigged for a long, long time. <br><br> Don’t take my word for it. Just look around. <br><br> • When women aren’t invited to the debate over our own health care and health insurance must cover Viagra but not birth control. • When we’re almost two decades into the 21st century and we still don’t have equal pay for equal work. • When a man running for President of the United States can get caught on tape bragging about sexual assault and Republican party leaders turn a blind eye. <br><br> Yeah, the system is rigged. <br><br> Keep going. • When the black-white wealth gap triples over the past three decades. • When racist voter ID laws and voter suppression tactics sprout like weeds all across the country. • When a man too racist to become a judge in the 1980s now runs the Department of Justice • When communities like Flint are living with poisoned water and polluted air. • When there’s still no justice for, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Philando Castile and so many more. <br><br> Yeah, the system is rigged. <br><br> Keep going. • When you can still be fired from your job because of who you love. • When you can’t use a public restroom or serve in the military because of your gender identity. • When you’re afraid to report a rape because ICE could split up your family. • When you’re treated like a suspect every minute of your life. <br><br> Yeah, the system is rigged. <br><br> And if you don’t feel like anyone in politics is doing anything to un-rig it, or it’s too broken to un-rig at all — well, that’s what a lot of folks felt last November, a lot of folks who should have been with us on election day but who stayed home. <br><br> So spare me the argument about whether we ought to be trying to bring back folks who voted for Donald Trump or trying to turn out folks who just didn’t vote. <br><br> Because we can’t do either of those things until we can show that things CAN change – and that WE will fight to change them. <br><br> It’s easy to make the case that Donald Trump and the Republicans aren’t the answer to any of these problems. Heck, they aren’t even trying. Look at the Republican priorities: <br><br> • Cut health care coverage for 25 million Americans and drive up insurance costs for millions more. <br><br> • Cut taxes for billionaires and giant corporations. <br><br> • Roll back Wall Street regulations, gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and let the big banks wreck our economy again. <br><br> • Turn polluters loose and let them spew, dump and destroy whenever and wherever they want. <br><br> • Zero out the programs that help people keep a roof over their heads. <br><br> • Double down against Planned Parenthood, against an undocumented immigrant’s right to due process, against a black American’s right to vote in an election. <br><br> • And this week, play a stupid, reckless game of chicken with a dangerous foreign power and threaten nuclear war. <br><br> The Republican agenda will make the powerful more powerful – and leave everyone else further behind. The Republican leadership is willing to threaten our health, our economy, and our basic safety. <br><br> All true, and we should say so clearly. But that’s not the end of our job. We have to show people that, when we get a chance to lead, things WILL start getting better. <br><br> And that starts with showing some backbone. Not just backbone when we stand up to Donald Trump, but backbone when we put forward an agenda. <br><br> For so many Americans, every day is a battle against powerful interests. It’s time for us to pick sides and get in the fight. <br><br> So let’s talk about picking sides: <br><br> It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of working people, on the side of Moms and Dads who dream of a better life for their kids, on the side of people in every part of this country and people of every race, gender, and religion who just want a level playing field and a chance to build a future. <br><br> And we know how to show them that their fight is our fight. <br><br> • Let’s start with jobs. <br><br> • It’s time to re-think the basic social contract on labor. We’re going to fight for fully portable benefits for everyone. And we’re going to fight to make sure that all work — full-time, part-time, gig — carries basic, pro-rata benefits. <br><br> • We’re going to fight to make it easier for workers to come together to form a union so they can take power into their own hands. <br><br> • And we’re going to turn the minimum wage into a living wage. Fight for $15! <br><br> It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of hard working families who are getting pounded every day. <br><br> • We’re going to fight for universal pre-K, and to make it easier for every family to get child care. <br><br> • We’re going to fight like hell to stop Republicans from jacking up the cost of health insurance and taking coverage away from millions. Trumpcare will not get one Democratic vote – not now, not ever. But it’s not enough just to defend the Affordable Care Act, we’re going to improve it, starting with bringing down the costs of prescription drugs – and leading the fight for Medicare for all. <br><br> • We’re going to make it possible for young people to go to college or get a technical degree debt-free. <br><br> • We’re going to fight for affordable housing and good schools across our country, from the biggest cities to the smallest towns and most remote rural homesteads. <br><br> • And we will fight our hearts out to defend — and expand — Social Security and Medicare. <br><br> It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of consumers. <br><br> • So we’re going to fight to break up the monopolies that are killing competition. <br><br> • We’re going to put a cop on the beat so that no one can steal your purse on Main Street or your pension on Wall Street. <br><br> • And whether you’re shopping for broadband or a student loan, an airline ticket or health insurance, we’re going to go to bat for you to help make damn sure you don’t get cheated. <br><br> It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of science. <br><br> • We’re done arguing about whether climate change is real – and we’re going to fight it with everything we have. <br><br> • We’re done arguing about whether trickle-down economics works – and we’re going to fight to build this economy so it works for working families. <br><br> • We’re done arguing about gun safety – and we’re going to fight for the common-sense reforms the overwhelming majority of Americans want. <br><br> It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of fairness and equality. <br><br> • So we’re going to fight for equal pay for equal work. <br><br> • We’re going to keep Planned Parenthood open, and we’re going to make sure women have access to safe, legal abortions. <br><br> • And we’re going to fight to put more women in positions of power, from committee rooms to boardrooms to that really nice Oval-shaped room at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. <br><br> • And we’re going to reform our criminal justice system so that getting caught with a baggie of pot doesn’t mean your life is ruined, and getting pulled over by the cops doesn’t mean your life is at risk. <br><br> It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of American values. <br><br> • So we’re going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform. And we’re going to say to every DREAMer in this country: You are an American. This country is your home. And we have your back. <br><br> • We’re going to fight to wipe the stain of Donald Trump’s Muslim ban off the books once and for all. And, by the way, Mr. President: We’re never, ever going to build your stupid wall. <br><br> • We’re also going to fight for our democracy. That means we’ll fight to reverse Citizens United so big corporations can’t BUY our elections, and we’ll fight to stop voter ID laws so Republicans can’t STEAL our elections either. <br><br> And, by the way: it’s time for us to up front about whose side we’re not on. <br><br> We’re not on the side of big Wall Street banks that break the law — we think everyone needs to be accountable. When bank CEOs break the law, they ought to go to jail just like everyone else. <br><br> We’re not on the side of the giant companies that want to twist government rules for themselves. We’re going to slam shut that revolving door, and we say enough is enough with corporate money that is drowning our democracy. <br><br> We’re not on the side of the bigots and the misogynists – and unlike the so-called Republican “leadership” in Washington, we’re not afraid to say it to their faces. <br><br> And we’re not on the side of foreign governments that hack our elections or politicians whose fragile egos put our national security at risk. <br><br> Folks, we don’t have to tip-toe. We don’t have to hedge our bets. We don’t have to ask permission from the pundits or the corporate CEOs – and we sure don’t have to ask permission from Mitch McConnell. [pause] Actually, that’s a good thing because I think he would probably tell me to sit down and shut up. Nevertheless, I would persist. <br><br> We don’t have to fear the wrath of the powerful, because when we’re bold enough to stand up for our values, when we’re bold enough to stand up for our fellow Americans, that’s when we ARE powerful. <br><br> Isn’t that the spirit that brought us all to this movement? <br><br> Isn’t that the reason we’re proud to call ourselves progressives? <br><br> Isn’t that the Democratic Party we want to call our own? <br><br> This fight is our fight. <br><br> This fight is the fight Americans have been waiting for someone to take on. <br><br> This fight is the fight Americans are ready to rally behind. <br><br> This fight is the fight Americans are counting on us to win. <br><br> This fight is my fight. This fight is your fight. <br><br> So let’s go win it! <br><br> Thank you! <br><br>",14/08/2017,10:14:05,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-08-12/Reuters/2017-08-12T191132Z_148594620_RC1341AE8210_RTRMADP_3_USA-POLITICS-NETROOTS.jpg,Sen.

3,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/08/15/dont-argue-with-pelosi-on-this-one-republicans/,"Don’t argue with Pelosi on this one, Republicans",Jennifer Rubin,blog,Politics,Right Turn,"On Monday, after President Trump’s grudging denunciation of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) released a statement: <br><br> The President’s statement on Saturday was a direct reflection of the fact that his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is an alt-right white supremacist sympathizer and a shameless enforcer of those un-American beliefs.  In his long overdue statement today, President Trump called white supremacists ‘repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.’  If the President is sincere about rejecting white supremacists, he should remove all doubt by firing Steve Bannon and the other alt-right white supremacist sympathizers in the White House. <br><br> From the beginning, President Trump has sheltered and encouraged the forces of bigotry and discrimination.  President Trump’s failure to immediately denounce white supremacy is well in line with the unmistakable conduct of his Administration toward immigrants, Muslims, and communities of color. <br><br> She concluded: “It shouldn’t take the President of the United States two days to summon the basic decency to condemn murder and violence by Nazis and white supremacists.” <br><br> It is no longer impossible to imagine that Bannon might be forced to step down. When Pelsoi, Rupert Murdoch and conservative anti-Trump writer David French all agree that he’s a drag on the president, perhaps he will finally return to Breitbart. French writes: <br><br> There’s a good reason that white nationalists rejoice at Steve Bannon’s proximity to power. There’s a good reason that countless Americans look at that man so close to the Oval Office and fear his influence on their president’s mind and heart. How can Trump look the American people in the face and say that he unequivocally condemns the alt-right when one of the men who did more than anyone else to enhance its influence works down the hall? <br><br> Whether it works or not, Republicans should join Pelosi. Republicans need to acknowledge an uncomfortable truth: Their party supported and still supports Trump, who feeds the monster of white resentment and who focuses their anger, fear and frustration on minorities. <br><br> The memes that immigrants are “stealing our jobs”; Christianity is a persecuted religion in the United States; Mexican immigrants are “murderers”; and millions of illegal immigrants voted in the election have given white nationalists rhetorical cover to propound their even more extreme racist views. Bannon and company have introduced in the Oval Office the “blood and soil” definition of nationalism, the suggestion that the media is the enemy of the people and a nonstop attack on the truth. They refused to abandon a presidential candidate who attacked a federal court judge on the basis of race, for heaven’s sake. <br><br> More than a year ago, the New York Times reported: <br><br> In countless collisions of color and creed, Donald J. Trump’s name evokes an easily understood message of racial hostility. Defying modern conventions of political civility and language, Mr. Trump has breached the boundaries that have long constrained Americans’ public discussion of race. <br><br> Mr. Trump has attacked Mexicans as criminals. He has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants. He has wondered aloud why the United States is not “letting people in from Europe.” <br><br> His rallies vibrate with grievances that might otherwise be expressed in private: about “political correctness,” about the ranch house down the street overcrowded with day laborers, and about who is really to blame for the death of a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo. In a country where the wealthiest and most influential citizens are still mostly white, Mr. Trump is voicing the bewilderment and anger of whites who do not feel at all powerful or privileged. <br><br> Trump and his apologists can deny until the cows come home that their intent was to stoke white racism, but in retrospect it’s clear that was to be the means by which Trump won the White House. Trump “opened the door to assertions of white identity and resentment in a way not seen so broadly in American culture in over half a century, according to those who track patterns of racial tension and antagonism in American life,” the Times reported. “Dozens of interviews — with ardent Trump supporters and curious students, avowed white nationalists, and scholars who study the interplay of race and rhetoric — suggest that the passions aroused and channeled by Mr. Trump take many forms, from earnest if muddled rebellion to deeper and more elaborate bigotry.” <br><br> This does not mean only racists supported Trump, nor does it mean that some of the positions he has taken have rationales not rooted in racism. But it is no longer deniable that Trump’s campaign and presidency have been fueled by white resentment toward minorities. And now we have unbridled expressions of white nationalism, something about which Trump was warned: <br><br> His slow reaction angered his critics even more as they were in the knowledge that a range of authority figures had warned Trump of the threat that white supremacists posed months before James Alex Fields Jr. plowed his car into counter-protesters, killing Heather Heyer. An intelligence bulletin obtained by Foreign Policy, entitled “White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence” and dated May 10, shows that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security briefed Trump as recently as May, at least indirectly, about the threat of the white supremacist movement and the threat of further attacks by members of this ultra-conservative group. <br><br> “We assess lone actors and small cells within the white supremacist extremist movement likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year,” the bulletin reads. <br><br> The FBI explicitly says in the briefing that white supremacists are to blame for the majority of domestic extremism. They “were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016…more than any other domestic extremist movement,” the document states. <br><br> Not only have the security services warned Trump about the threat of white supremacists, but so too have his Democratic rivals and predecessors. <br><br> What did Trump do in response? Did he ignore a domestic terrorism threat because it undercut his political message? <br><br> And so we come to the present. Unless and until Trump is impeached, resigns or loses reelection, he and his brand of politics dominate the GOP. The only means to free itself of the yoke of Trump is to discard the personnel and policies that embody his white racial resentment ploy. With a unified voice, Republicans can denounce the president’s alt-right advisers, the voting fraud commission (which itself is a fraud), the proposed pardon of anti-immigrant hero Joe Arpaio and other symbols of Trump’s identification with white grievance. The GOP either rejects Trump or once and for all it sacrifices the Party of Lincoln to a ragtag band of white nationalists — some more subtle than others but all an anathema to American democracy. <br><br>",15/08/2017,7:15:27,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/19/Production/Outlook/Images/Botsford170502Trump14819.JPG,White House senior adviser Stephen K.

2,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/08/16/republicans-cut-the-outrage-its-time-to-disown-trump/,"Republicans, cut the outrage. It’s time to disown Trump.",Jennifer Rubin,blog,Politics,Right Turn,"The party of Lincoln is now the party of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and Southern slave owners who decided to kill fellow Americans so that they could keep men, women and children enslaved. The Republican Party, in other words, has obliterated its entire historical legacy and become the party of the Enemies of Lincoln. <br><br> And let’s be clear: Republicans cannot say, “That’s not us — that’s just President Trump.” They supported him, they elected him, they defended him and they gave him the aura of a normal presidency. They cannot be the party of Lincoln and be the party of Trump. In that vein, we can dispense with Republicans’ “outrage,” “frustration,” “anger” and all other meaningless expressions of internal sentiment. Unless and until they are prepared to do something — not just send tweets — to politically disown Trump, the party is toast and none of its members should be elected or reelected. <br><br> How would they do this? First, elected officials must deny Trump the audience he so desperately craves. They need not appear with him, nor invite him to the Hill. (The State of the Union can be delivered from the White House or in writing; he would besmirch the House by appearing there.) Lawmakers and state officials should not troop to the White House for photo ops. They can communicate with the White House by phone or through aides. In short, Trump must be shunned and ostracized. He is not fit for polite company, let alone the presidency. He has demolished the rules of civilized behavior, and therefore should enjoy none of the ceremonial niceties that are extended to normal presidents. <br><br> Second, beyond resolutions condemning Trump’s remarks, every member of Congress should do his or her utmost to remove the neo-Nazi iconography in their districts and states. Neo-Nazis have claimed the Confederacy as their own — and therefore have reminded the rest of us that the Confederate statues are not tributes to patriotism, gallantry or liberty but to treason, inhumanity and slavery. That is why neo-Nazis identify with these symbols of the Old South. That is why they have no place in a democratic society built on the principle that “All men are created equal.” State and local officials need to carefully examine school curriculum to make sure students are not confused as to the heroes and the villains in the Civil War. Every student should learn to spot and debunk the “Lost Cause” propaganda. Perhaps April 9 should be a national holiday commemorating the Confederacy’s surrender and the magnanimity displayed by President Abraham Lincoln and U.S. generals toward their defeated foes. <br><br> Third, Cabinet members, sub-Cabinet officials, staffers and outside participants on councils, commissions and committees must leave the administration. It’s not enough, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, to look on with a pained expression as the president declares that some of the white nationalists were “very fine” folks. He deceived you and others as to what he would say and he has shown himself unfit. You cannot serve in the administration of a neo-Nazi sympathizer. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, why stay in an administration in which you command so little respect and in which you must lend your own reputation to a disgraceful president? (Defense Secretary Jim Mattis should remain, a final backstop to prevent a military disaster.) <br><br> Fourth, Republicans must treat the president as they would someone not of their party — for he is not, to repeat, of the party of Lincoln. If Hillary Clinton refused to release her tax returns, hired unqualified relatives, kept business ventures that posed a conflict of interest and violated the Constitution’s emoluments clause, Republicans would commence hearings and pass legislation to put an end to all of it. It’s long past the time that Trump should be permitted to escape the kind of inquiry Republicans would insist upon for any Democratic president. By refusing to do so, the GOP is saying: “He’s one of ours. He’s a Republican, so we don’t rock the boat.” <br><br> Fifth, now would be a fine time for formation of a third party, one that can at the end of the Trump presidency repeal and replace the GOP. The Free Republican Party, the Appomattox Republicans (It cannot be said enough: The Confederates were losers) or whatever ex-Republicans in the center-right call themselves can endorse for office defectors from the GOP and reclaim Republicans who have disassociated themselves with the GOP thanks to Trump. Moderate Republican House members of the Tuesday Group, the new Centrist Project (dedicated to backing independent candidates), members of Stand Up Republic (founded by 2016 conservative independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin and his former running mate, Mindy Finn) and others have the chance to stake their claim as the true successors to the party of Lincoln. Those who have wrestled with the question as to whether the GOP could be reformed or whether it should be discarded in light of Trump’s GOP takeover have their answer. If they cannot disgorge him, they must start over. <br><br> In sum, Republicans’ words are insufficient and, at this point, insufferable. When we look back at this time, the only thing people will ask is: “What did you do?” Republicans will need a better answer than “I was outraged and gave tough quotes — on background.” <br><br>",16/08/2017,7:15:06,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/15/Editorial-Opinion/Images/federate_Monument_Protest-Social_Media_40466-e118c-2369.jpg,White nationalist demonstrators are surrounded by counter-demonstrators last weekend at the entrance to Lee Park in Charlottesville.

The #RiseAndOrganize campaign, explained O’Connell, would involve Democrats finding the best opportunities to grill their representatives in public, as well as talking to people on the sidelines about the need to get involved. <br><br> “Using the message #RiseAndOrganize Democrats will communicate with their family, friends, neighbors and community and send a message — Do not lose hope, Do not give in to fear,” the DNC explained in a memo announcing the campaign. <br><br> More than 100 events were already being planned for the weekend, with a goal of hitting all 50 states. All summer, the existing network of progressive groups has been organizing people to attend congressional town hall meetings, as well as vigils after major events. Scores of gatherings to condemn the violence in Charlottesville, in which a woman was killed, were put together within hours of the news breaking, with more vigils following on Sunday. <br><br> But the progressive groups that organized those vigils have wildly diverging views of political action. In Durham, N.C., where a Confederate statue was pulled down by a cheering mob, the city has arrested Maoist activists who had worked only in fringe politics. In Birmingham, Ala., the leading Democratic candidate for a special U.S. Senate election offered to speak at a vigil in the city’s Five Points district, but decided against adding a political tinge to it. <br><br> The #RiseAndOrganize push is the latest example of the Tom Perez-era DNC taking cues from political protests, in the hope that people will soon be ready to pivot from marches to voter canvasses. At the same time, in a series of interviews, White House political strategist Steve Bannon argued that Democrats would lose votes if they became the party of “identity politics” and protests. <br><br> “The longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em,” Bannon told the American Prospect’s Robert Kuttner. “I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.” <br><br> One focus of many of the vigils — and of a new resolution from some members of the Congressional Black Caucus — is whether Bannon should be fired from the White House. <br><br>",17/08/2017,9:20:29,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/17/Local/Images/Charlottesville_SG09.JPG,"CHARLOTTESVILLE — Hundreds of people march with lit candles across the University of Virginia campus on Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017, in Charlottesville in a vigil for a woman who was killed Aug. 12 when a car rammed people protesting a white nationalist demonstration.
