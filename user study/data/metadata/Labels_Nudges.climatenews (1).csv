At a Camp David news conference Thursday, he thanked senators for moving forward with what he called a “smart, progressive, growth-promoting trade deal” and lauded most of the enforcement provisions. <br><br> “Despite the fact that there have been very genuine problems with some trade deals in the past, the approach we are taking here, I think, is the right one,” he said. <br><br> Earlier on the Senate floor, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who negotiated the fast-track bill with congressional Republican leaders but then stalled it this week over the enforcement concerns, declared “a new day for trade policy.” <br><br> “You can pack trade agreements full of lofty goals and principles. You can amass all of the enforcement ideas you might want. But it doesn’t do any good,” Wyden said, “if you don’t have real enforcement tools.” <br><br> The enforcement bill passed Thursday 78 to 20, and a second piece of the trade package, extending aid programs for developing countries, passed 97 to 1. But the bulk of the Senate debate is expected next week, following the afternoon procedural vote on proceeding with the fast-track bill, also known as “Trade Promotion Authority,” or TPA. <br><br> By passing the bill, Congress would relinquish its ability to amend trade deals negotiated by the executive branch, leaving them subject to a simple up-or-down vote. The 12-nation ­Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, is the most ambitious deal likely to come up for consideration. <br><br> Ratifying the TPP, which enjoys broad support from Republicans, is a cornerstone of Obama’s second-term agenda, with a GOP-controlled Congress unlikely to move forward on other key priorities. But the trade legislation faces fierce opposition from most congressional Democrats, who have been rallied by the most loyal constituent of the party’s political base: labor unions. <br><br> “This will be a very, very major vote on the scorecard,” AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka said Thursday in a discussion with Washington Post reporters and editors. “It means so much to working people that, on this one, if you are against us, you are against us.” <br><br> Democratic fast-track skeptics pledged Thursday to offer amendments — including enforcement and currency ma­nipu­la­tion provisions — to that bill amid warnings from Republicans and the Obama administration that they could constitute “poison pills” tanking overall support. <br><br> The White House said in a statement that the currency ma­nipu­la­tion language passed in the separate bill “would undermine our international efforts to address this issue, raise highly problematic questions about consistency with our international obligations, lead to other countries pursuing retaliatory measures that could hurt our exporters, and be difficult to administer.” Obama said Thursday that the provision could have a “blowback effect on our ability to have our own monetary policy.” <br><br> Republican leaders said Thursday they hope to finish consideration of the trade legislation by the end of next week, before a week-long Memorial Day recess. Then the debate would move into the House, where Democratic opposition is more robust and a significant bloc of Republicans also opposes granting fast-track authority. <br><br> Trumka decried the move to separate the currency provisions from the fast-track deal. Those provisions could lead to the imposition of punitive duties on goods imported from countries found to be depressing the value of their currencies, <br><br> “What do you think happens to it when it gets to the House? It’s DOA,” he said. “Unless it all goes together, it’s not going to work and we’re not going to be for it, and we’re going to be hard-edged about it.” <br><br> House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) offered support for that view Thursday. “To think that Congress can legislate what currency valuations are between countries is almost laughable,” he said at a news briefing. <br><br> Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the minority whip and a free-trade skeptic, dismissed suggestions that Democratic leaders had undermined the opposition to fast track by agreeing to a separate enforcement bill, which could die in the House or be vetoed by Obama. <br><br> “We’re going to come back to it next week” as an amendment on the fast-track bill, he said. But he also acknowledged that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) may take steps to limit amendments in order to complete Senate consideration of the trade bills before Memorial Day. <br><br> Anti-fast-track Democrats said they will continue to look for opportunities to toughen the bill. “I think we still have opportunities for debate, and we’ll be doing that next week,” said Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.). “Currency is a significant issue for the auto industry that has to be addressed, so that is my focus.” <br><br> Senate Republicans set up Monday votes on two amendments — one Republican, one Democratic — before finishing their week’s work Thursday evening. <br><br> “What I don’t want to happen is that we get crammed up and then people feel like they’ve been shut out of the process and get bent out of shape,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), McConnell’s top leadership deputy. “There are actually some people who don’t want to pass a bill, and they’re happy to cause as many impediments and obstructions as they can.” <br><br> Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), an outspoken proponent of the currency ma­nipu­la­tion measure, said he was not dead-set on attaching it to the fast-track bill. But he said the enforcement bill, which includes currency language, may need to move in concert with fast track. <br><br> “I don’t think there are enough votes in the House to pass [fast track],” Schumer told reporters Thursday. “It may be that some of them will say, ‘Maybe I’ll go with it if currency becomes law.’ . . . It may well be that currency is needed to get the TPA bill through, given the reluctance of Democrats.” <br><br> Among the factors driving that reluctance is labor’s suggestion that it will abandon campaign support for fast-track supporters in Congress. While union endorsement decisions are made on the state or local level, Trumka said he expects the issue to trump most other considerations. <br><br> “If I were predicting, I would say some people would probably have primary opponents because of this vote,” Trumka said. “I’m not threatening that — I’m just saying that is something that will happen. . . . We’re talking about this being an issue that we believe will be detrimental to working people for an indefinite future. It will suppress our wages indefinitely. And we’re going to fight.” <br><br> Trumka said Democrats who vote for fast track cannot count on the inclusion of worker assistance or their other pro-labor votes to retain their labor support. <br><br> “We’re not going to overlook it,” he said. “We’re not going to walk away and say, ‘Oh well.’ . . . We’re going to use every arrow in our quiver.” <br><br> Paul Kane and Kelsey Snell contributed to this report. <br><br>",14/05/2015,12:14:00,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/05/14/National-Politics/Images/2015-05-14T175058Z_01_WAS912_RTRIDSP_3_USA-TRADE-3793.jpg,"Sens.

19,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/21/poll-65-percent-of-democrats-want-party-to-stand-up-to-trump/,Poll: 65 percent of Democrats want party to ‘stand up’ to Trump,David Weigel,blog,Politics,Post Politics,"The Pew Research Center's postelection voter survey has found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats (65 percent) — and 39 percent of all voters — want the opposition party to “stand up” to President-elect Donald Trump, “even if less gets done in Washington.” As the minority party studies the aftermath of the 2004 and 2008 elections for clues on how to stage a comeback, Pew's numbers suggest that there is more enthusiasm for opposition to Trump than to any recently elected president. <br><br> According to Pew's 2008 polling, just 36 percent of Republican voters, and 22 percent of all voters, said that their party should oppose the incoming President Obama if it meant slowing down the work of the country. In 2008, just 11 percent of Democrats said they wanted Republicans to be a check on the president; last week, 14 percent of Republicans said that they wanted Democrats to be a check on Trump. <br><br> In 2009, the Republicans obliged the minority — though, tellingly, they were slow to make clear what they were doing. In November 2008, at a similar point in Obama's transition, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) strategically praised Obama's more bipartisan Cabinet hires and suggested that he could pass a crisis agenda through Congress quickly if he did not run to the left. <br><br> “This is an opportunity to tackle big issues and to do them in the middle,” McConnell said at a lame-duck news conference in 2008. “It would not be a good idea for the new administration, in my view, to go down a laundry list of left-wing proposals and try to jam them through the Congress.” <br><br> In January, as the Obama White House prioritized the passage of a massive stimulus spending plan, McConnell continued to suggest that Republicans want to help him pass it — especially a component that consisted of a large tax cut. “Depending upon how this tax component is crafted,” McConnell said, “it could well have broad Republican appeal and make it much more likely that the measure passes with broad bipartisan support, which is what the new president would like and what we would like.” <br><br> In the end, McConnell offered nearly no bipartisan cover at all. Just three Senate Republicans backed the stimulus package, which had been shaped to attract bipartisan support; no House Republicans supported it. In 2010, McConnell told journalist Joshua Green that the Republicans avoided any buy-in with Obama's bills to deny any appearance of bipartisanship. <br><br> “We worked very hard to keep our fingerprints off of these proposals,” McConnell says. “Because we thought — correctly, I think — that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisan. When you hang the ‘bipartisan’ tag on something, the perception is that differences have been worked out, and there’s a broad agreement that that’s the way forward.” <br><br> Democrats now seem to be heading for a similar showdown. In their first comments after the election, Democratic leaders such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Senate Minority Leader-elect Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said they were open to dealing with Trump on big projects. But in an interview published this weekend in the New York Times, Schumer clarified that Democrats would deal with Trump only if he met them on their goals. <br><br> “We are saying, ‘Mr. President you have two choices: Work with us and you will have to alienate your Republican colleagues, or break your promises to blue-collar America,’ ” he said. “I believe that blue-collar America voted for Trump mainly because of Democratic issues like trade, not for Republican issues like tax cuts for the wealthy.” <br><br> Like McConnell in 2008, Schumer seemed to be laying the groundwork for near-total opposition of Trump bills, on the assumption that Republicans will not embrace deficit spending. <br><br>",21/11/2016,12:22:55,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-11-19/AP/Schumer-54949.jpg,Senate Minority Leader-elect Charles E.

18,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/12/31/why-some-republicans-think-theyre-winning-the-fiscal-cliff/,Why Republicans think they’re winning the ‘fiscal cliff’,Ezra Klein,blog,Politics,Wonkblog,"Consider the ongoing ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations from the Republican Party's perspective. Not the revanchist conservatives who never believed they'd need to compromise, but the realists who knew, when they lost the election, that compromise was inevitable. <br><br> To Republicans, these negotiations have always had two discrete parts. First, there was the fiscal cliff, with its promise of huge, automatic tax increases. They've always known that the fiscal cliff gives President Obama and the Democrats huge leverage. But after the fiscal cliff comes the debt ceiling, and they've always believed that that's when they'll get their leverage: Just as in 2011, they'll force the White House to cut spending if it wants to avoid default. <br><br> The question for Republicans has always been how to get to the debt ceiling while giving up the minimum in tax increases. Many of them figured that they'd at least have to give on the Bush tax cuts for income over $250,000.  <br><br> When these negotiations began, the White House was unyielding on that point, with the president promising to veto anything that didn't raise tax rates for income over $250,000. Asked by House Speaker John Boehner what he'd trade for $800 billion in revenue -- about the cost of the high-income Bush tax cuts -- Obama was firm. ”You get nothing,” the president said. “I get that for free.” <br><br> To make matters worse for Republicans, the Senate had already passed a bill letting those cuts expire back in July because Minority Leader Mitch McConnell figured it would be too politically damaging to block. If Mitt Romney had won the election, that bill would have died. But after Obama won on a platform that was barely about anything aside from letting those tax cuts expire, it seemed inevitable he'd get it done. It was his due. <br><br> To the GOP's delight, that no longer seems to be the case. In the Obama-Boehner negotiations, the White House offered to raise the threshold from $250,000 to $400,000. McConnell, in his negotiations with Harry Reid and now Joe Biden, has been trying to raise that to $500,000. It's clear to the Republicans that they will get past the fiscal cliff with a smaller tax increase than they thought. Perhaps much smaller. Huzzah! <br><br> That will set up a fight over the debt ceiling. The Republicans plan to say that now that they broke their pledge and voted for a tax increase, they'll insist on a dollar of spending cuts for every dollar of debt-ceiling increase -- the so-called ""Boehner rule"". The White House plans to insist that it won't negotiate over the debt ceiling at all. <br><br> Republicans I've spoken to laugh at this bluster. Obama is already negotiating over the debt ceiling, they point out. He began the fiscal cliff negotiations by saying he wanted a permanent solution to the debt ceiling. Then it was a two-year increase in the debt limit. Now he's going to sign off on a mini-deal that doesn't increase the debt ceiling at all. Does that really sound like someone who's going to hold firm when faced with global economic chaos? The White House always talks tough at the beginning of negotiations and then always folds at the end. Republicans are confident that the debt ceiling will be no different. <br><br> All this raises the tantalizing prospect for Republicans that they could end these negotiations having given up less tax revenue than they ever thought possible -- less tax revenue than Boehner offered Obama, even -- but still getting their entitlement cuts. Oh, and because there was never a big deal, they won't have to agree to much stimulus, either. All in all, a pretty big win, and it wouldn't have been possible without the White House's baffling inability to stick to a negotiating position. <br><br> To Democrats, the mistake Republicans are making is in assuming that the White House will negotiate over the debt ceiling. They believe White House officials mean it when they say that if Boehner and McConnell choose to crash the global economy, then that's their business. They think Republicans are making a huge tactical error: They're giving Democrats a tax increase now assuming they won't have to hand over another one later, that they can trade a debt ceiling increase for entitlement cuts. But they're wrong. Republicans will quickly find the debt ceiling is a nonstarter with the White House. As soon as Democrats pocket this tax increase, they'll turn around and demand a dollar-for-dollar ratio of tax increases for entitlement cuts. And having already increased tax rates, Democrats can magnanimously agree to raise the new revenue through tax reform of the sort that Romney proposed. But in total, the two deals will raise more in taxes than a single deal ever would have. <br><br> Both Democrats and Republicans can't be right. Either Republicans are right that they won't budge on taxes again and the White House will fold on the debt ceiling in a few months or Democrats are right that Republicans will move on taxes after finding the White House resolute on the debt ceiling. The third possibility, of course, is that both sides are wrong, and we actually do break through the debt ceiling, unleashing economic chaos. <br><br> Related: Why the White House thinks it's winning the fiscal cliff. <br><br>",31/12/2012,11:52:07,https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2012/12/boehner-and-mcconnell-3.jpg,Perhaps this is all going according to plan?

17,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/20/senate-democrats-promise-to-pass-a-budget/,Senate Democrats promise to pass a budget. Why is this a big deal?,Suzy Khimm,blog,Politics,Wonkblog,"Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) made headlines Sunday morning by promising that Senate Democrats will write and pass a full tax and spending bill by the March 1 deadline for the next budget. ""It’s going to be a great opportunity for us because in our budget that we will pass, we will have tax reform, which many of my Republican colleagues like. But it’s going to include revenues,"" Schumer said on ""Meet The Press."" <br><br> The pledge by Schumer, the Senate's third-ranking Democrat, indicates that Democrats are willing to go along with the proposal that House Republicans made at the end of their retreat last week: They'll extend the debt ceiling without upfront spending cuts for three months, so long as the Senate passes a budget blueprint this spring. <br><br> But such negotiations may raise a fairly obvious question: Why is the very act of passing a budget a point of contention in the first place? Isn't this what Congress should be doing in the first place? <br><br> Technically, the 2011 debt-ceiling deal already set the discretionary spending levels for the next 10 years, which includes nearly $1 trillion in discretionary cuts that have already begun to take effect. But, as the New York Times points out, Congress can still vote to change the 2011 caps. And by agreeing to pass a new budget—one that will presumably replace the sequester's $1.2 trillion in cuts through entitlement and revenue changes as well as discretionary cuts—both Democrats and Republicans have agreed to revisit the budget through a traditional budget resolution process that's been stymied for the past four years.* <br><br> Traditionally, the budget rarely passes on schedule, but the process has broken down more dramatically as political polarization and angst over spending has surged on Capitol Hill. As I've reported before, Congress has enacted a full set of spending bills by the annual deadline only four times in 30 years (1977, 1989, 1995 and 1997), relying instead on temporary spending bills and omnibus bills to keep the government running. <br><br> Before Congress and the president even get to enacting appropriation bills, however, Congress needs to pass a budget resolution—the blueprint for spending that's further delineated in the individual appropriations bills. In fact, the Senate hasn't passed a budget resolution since April 2009, and even then, the tax and spending legislation didn't receive a single Republican vote in Congress. <br><br> Since the GOP won back the House, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has held back from writing a full budget blueprint: Democrats have instead resorted solely on omnibus appropriations and continuing resolutions to keep the government going, thwarting the GOP's ability to offer amendments to cut spending or put political pressure on Democrats. ""The party in the minority has traditionally used the budget debate to score political points with amendments that mean little but are intended to put senators on record on contentious political issues,"" Jonathan Weisman explains. <br><br> Republicans have turned the Senate's inaction on a budget resolution into a major talking point. (""1,361 Days Since Senate Passed a Budget,"" Speaker Boehner's (R-Ohio) office declared Friday.) But the budgeting process has also slowed down in part because of the very reforms that House Republicans instituted in 2010 to clean up the way that Washington deals with spending. When House Republicans came to power, they passed a ban on earmarks, which have traditionally greased the wheels of budgeting. BusinessWeek explains what's happened as a result: <br><br> Since the ban took effect, the appropriations process has “melted down,” says Sean Kelly, a professor at California State University Channel Islands... In dozens of conversations with staffers and members of Congress, he’s found that there’s now less incentive for a politician to serve on an appropriations committee because there’s nothing to hand out. As a result, says Kelly, the committees attract more partisans and fewer pragmatists–to its detriment. “There’s a human element in lawmaking that is real,” says Tom Cole, a six-term House Republican from Oklahoma. Without earmarks, “you’re removing all incentive for people to vote for things that are tough.” <br><br> In the next few months, Senate Democrats will take steps to ensure that they'll pass a full budget resolution: Schumer's spokesman tweeted that Democrats will use the budget reconciliation process to fast-track the reach a deficit deal, which allows the Senate to pass it with 51 votes and avoid a potential filibuster. But that also means that the bill will be strictly limited to provisions that have a major fiscal impact, limiting outside horse-trading as well. <br><br> *Post has been updated to explain how the 2011 debt-ceiling deal affects the current budget negotiations, and to clarify the difference between a budget resolution and individual appropriations bills. <br><br>",20/01/2013,15:44:23,https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/01/CRs.jpg,"Continuing resolutions per year, including both stopgap extensions and omnibus bills.

The two months between Election Day and New Year’s Eve were a period of intense, partisan negotiations. <br><br> Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) had pulled back from the talks, leaving the White House, in the person of Vice President Biden, to cut a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). <br><br> The final vote on the package seemed like a bipartisan triumph: 89 senators supported the deal, which included the permanent extension of the Bush-era tax breaks for most workers. But the vote masked a vast underlying tension among some of the players. <br><br> The episode left a particularly bitter taste for Reid’s chief of staff, David Krone, who had been privately assuring people that there would be no deal and that Congress would go “over the cliff” — as taxes soared for every American, giving the Democrats great political leverage when Congress returned for a period of more intense negotiations in January 2013. <br><br> Technically, the president’s first term wasn’t even complete, and he had just been reelected, but the fault lines within his own party were already sharply drawn. That tension blew up Tuesday when Krone’s comments about Democrats’ dismal showing in the 2014 midterms went public. He accused Obama of paying “lip service” to concerns about helping finance the midterm elections and said the president was an anchor that took down Democrats across the country, costing them the Senate majority. <br><br> “The president’s approval rating is barely 40 percent,” Krone said. “What else more is there to say?” <br><br> It was an unusual breach of Washington decorum that stunned a political community used to the shadowy “background” comments from “senior administration officials” or “senior Senate aides.” In general, staffers do not say such things on the record about a sitting president, especially from the same party. <br><br> [READ: More about Krone’s comments and how Democratic infighting helped Republicans gain control of the Senate] <br><br> Krone’s move wasn’t some rogue operation of a staffer gone wild. He is a close and loyal aide to Reid, having met him years ago when he — Krone — was a telecommunications lobbyist and executive. He’s the rare senior congressional staffer who did the reverse move in the revolving door — he made his millions on the outside, including a stint with Comcast, and then went into the public sector to work for Reid. <br><br> Krone joined Reid’s team as deputy chief of staff, helping guide him through a rocky 2010 reelection, and for the past four years as chief, Krone has channelled Reid. So his comments can reasonably be viewed as Reid’s views of Obama. <br><br> The majority leader and the president have had an odd relationship. <br><br> In the first two years of Obama’s presidency, Reid and Senate Democrats were the bulwark of Obama’s agenda. Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s massive House majority could afford to lose the support of up to 40 members and still pass the president’s policies under the chamber’s simple majority rules, but Reid had to corral all 60 members of the Democratic caucus to pass legislation that wasn’t necessarily in the best interest of some senators from deeply conservative states. <br><br> Consistently, Senate Democrats felt that they were taking on the most risk as they supported Obama’s $800 billion stimulus plan, the Dodd-Frank rewrite of Wall Street laws and, most of all, the Affordable Care Act. These included a group of senators who first won seats in 2008 and rode into office with Obama. Among them were Mark Begich (Alaska), Kay Hagan (N.C.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Mark Udall (Colo.) and Mark Warner (Va.). <br><br> Three of those five appear to have lost on Tuesday, and Shaheen and Warner survived only by the narrowest of margins. <br><br> Throughout the tough votes, those Democrats enjoyed almost no real relationship with Obama, whose approach to social engagement with lawmakers is almost nonexistent. <br><br> Udall is considered one of the best golfers in the Capitol, and also one of the most genuinely likable people. In six years, he was asked to join the president for a round of golf just once — a few days after The Washington Post noted that Obama had never played golf with Udall. (The round was on a Monday afternoon, and it lasted only 15 holes because the Senate came back into session and votes were called.) <br><br> The Obama-Senate Democrats relationship somehow remained intact even through the tough 2010 midterm elections, when Democrats lost the House majority and saw their Senate count shrink to 53 seats. <br><br> In the summer of 2011, Obama played a round of golf with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). From there, the duo got close to reaching a massive budget deal that would have raised taxes and cut entitlement programs — slashing at two political sacred cows for Republicans and Democrats. <br><br> But Reid’s operation, along with his close ally, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), did not trust Obama’s negotiating skills, and at one point they directly leaked the emerging proposal, timing the release precisely so that the news broke just as Jack Lew, then the director of the Office of Management and Budget, entered a meeting with Senate Democrats. <br><br> As aides then recounted, Reid read the news bulletin aloud to a stunned audience of staunch liberals who had protected Social Security and Medicare with their political lives. Reid turned the lectern over to Lew. <br><br> The grand bargain, at that point, was essentially dead. <br><br> In 2012, however, the two sides ran perfect campaigns. <br><br> Then came “the cliff.” <br><br> Boehner and Obama again came close to a grand bargain, and it infuriated Democrats who saw it as fruitless, given how slight a hold the speaker had on his conservative ranks in the House. That effort folded, and indeed, as Krone had been predicting, it seemed that the economy was headed for a brief-but-significant jolt of higher taxes. <br><br> Many Democrats figured that once the cliff had been jumped, all the leverage would be in their hands and they could extract even deeper concessions from Republicans, particularly on across-the-board spending cuts that they wanted to nix. <br><br> Reid and McConnell engaged in some brief talks — talks that included a key mistake by Democrats: They made an offer on the tax levels, and Republicans actually accepted it. There were other key issues to resolve, but once that central issue was settled, the momentum headed toward resolution. <br><br> At that point, McConnell called Biden and famously asked: “Does anyone down there know how to make a deal?” <br><br> Reid, Schumer and other leaders and their advisers then waited to see the final details, furious that the deal was being made. Democrats leaked stories to The Post, Politico and other outlets about how at one point Reid took an offer that Obama was considering making to McConnell and threw it into the fireplace in his office on the second floor of the Capitol as others watched. <br><br> On Tuesday, after Democrats got stomped, the man they feared the most, Mitch McConnell, had the biggest smile of all. <br><br> “Friends, this experiment in Big Government has lasted long enough. It’s time to move in a new direction,” he said in claiming victory. <br><br>",05/11/2014,19:49:39,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/11/04/National-Politics/Images/RTR3Y2DD.jpg,"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), center, speaks at a news conference with, from left, Sens.

That would be enough to bottle up Republican attempts to overturn the deal, sparing Obama the drama and embarrassment of having to veto legislation rejecting it. <br><br> But the milestone earned a restrained reaction from the White House and other supporters Tuesday. The muted response reflected uncertainty over whether the filibuster margins in the Senate will hold in the face of Republican attacks, a lack of enthusiasm among many Democratic endorsers and a GOP united against the deal. <br><br> Announcements in support of the deal Tuesday came from Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), establishing a margin that would deprive Republicans of the 60 votes necessary to close debate on disapproval legislation and advance it to Obama’s desk. <br><br> Also Tuesday, the last undecided Senate Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, announced her opposition, dashing any White House hopes for bipartisan support. A fifth Democrat making an announcement Tuesday, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), also said he would vote to disapprove of the deal. <br><br> The spate of announcements came on the day lawmakers reassembled in Washington after a month-long break, with the Iran deal at the top of a high-stakes list of September business. <br><br> With 38 senators — enough to sustain a presidential veto — already publicly favoring the deal coming out of the holiday weekend, the decisions of the remaining undecided had little bearing on the ultimate implementation of the deal. <br><br> But the question of whether Democrats would cobble together enough support to prevent the GOP resolution from reaching Obama’s desk has been closely watched on Capitol Hill. Deal backers have worked to maintain steady momentum in support of the pact, and forcing a veto would extend the congressional debate just as many Democrats are hoping to pivot public attention to the next crucial issue: funding the federal government. <br><br> Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said forcing a veto would amount to a “procedural charade” that would damage Congress’s credibility. “The president’s hand is strengthened in the region and around the world if we don’t have to drag this out for another few weeks,” he said. <br><br> At the White House, press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration felt “gratified” by the growing support for the Iran nuclear deal, and he suggested that the White House expects Democratic supporters to filibuster the vote to disapprove the accord. <br><br> Supporters “should take the necessary steps in Congress to prevent Congress from undermining the agreement,” Earnest said. He noted that Republicans often used similar methods to “stymie the president’s agenda” when the GOP was in the minority in the Senate. <br><br> The prospect of a filibuster prompted sparring between the party floor leaders Tuesday afternoon, moments after the Senate gaveled back to business. <br><br> Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) took aim at Democrats, saying senators “should not hide behind procedural obfuscation to shield the president or our individual views,” arguing that the Iran disapproval should be decided on a majority vote for final passage, not on a procedural vote requiring 60 senators. <br><br> But Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) cited multiple occasions where McConnell threw up procedural roadblocks when Republicans were in the minority. “After the numerous speeches that he has given about the 60-vote threshold on everything important, is he suggesting this Iran agreement is not important?” Reid asked. <br><br> Obama aides said the Iran deal has been the White House’s top priority for months, with the president and other top administration officials engaged in a determined lobbying effort with Congress members and interest groups, as well as the general public. <br><br> Obama has spoken or met with more than 120 members of Congress since the deal was announced, aides said, and Cabinet officials have briefed more than 220 lawmakers. They emphasized that Obama has continued to talk with lawmakers by phone over the congressional recess, noting that he made 30 calls during his vacation on Martha’s Vineyard in August. <br><br> “We feel gratified today,” Earnest said, “because the vast majority of those who did take time to consider the terms of the agreement and to participate in briefings and meetings, and in many cases even hear firsthand from the president . . . indicated their plan to support the agreement.” <br><br> Blumenthal, Peters and Wyden had long been considered possible opponents of the deal, given the opposition of the Israeli government and significant elements of the American Jewish community. Blumenthal and Wyden are Jewish, and Peters has close ties to Michigan’s Jewish leadership; all have made comments critical of the deal since its announcement in July. <br><br> But all three said in separate statements Tuesday that the deal negotiated by Obama in conjunction with international allies is, while imperfect, the best path forward. <br><br> “While this is not the agreement I would have accepted at the negotiating table, it is better than no deal at all,” Blumenthal said. <br><br> Wyden said: “This agreement with the duplicitous and untrustworthy Iranian regime falls short of what I had envisioned, however I have decided the alternatives are even more dangerous.” <br><br> Said Peters: “Despite my serious concerns with this agreement, I have unfortunately become convinced that we are faced with no viable alternative.” <br><br> Manchin was the fourth Senate Democrat to oppose the deal, following Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), Robert Menendez (N.J.) and Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.). <br><br> Manchin, who said in July he was “leaning strongly” toward supporting it, said in a statement that he “could not ignore the fact that Iran, the country that will benefit most from sanctions being lifted, refuses to change its 36-year history of sponsoring terrorism. . . . I cannot gamble our security, and that of our allies, on the hope that Iran will conduct themselves differently than it has for the last 36 years.” <br><br> He added that if Iran is caught violating the nuclear agreement, “I have grave doubts that we will have unified, committed partners willing to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” <br><br> Some uncertainty persisted after Tuesday’s announcements, in part because at least one supporter of the deal, Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), suggested last week he might not join a filibuster. A spokesman said Tuesday that Coons “simply hopes that the process will happen in a way that makes clear where each senator stands on this critical agreement.” <br><br> Sen. Lindsay O. Graham (R-S.C.) suggested a filibuster would be a “blot” on the Senate: “Have we sunk that low? If you really believe this is a good deal, take the floor and tell me why. . . . We all should be on record voting either for it or against it.” <br><br> But the debate would be limited in any case: Congress faces a tight timeline for taking action under review legislation passed this year. Lawmakers have until Sept. 17 to weigh in for or against the agreement, and McConnell on Tuesday made procedural moves to limit floor amendments in order to speed consideration the bill. <br><br> McConnell said last month that he expects to have a debate beforehand “with the dignity and respect that it deserves” — including the rare spectacle of having all 100 senators at their desks on the floor. On Tuesday, he asked all senators to be present in the Senate chamber starting Wednesday afternoon. <br><br> Karoun Demirjian and David Nakamura contributed to this report. <br><br>",08/09/2015,18:06:59,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/09/National-Politics/Images/2015-09-08T222136Z_01_WAS918_RTRIDSP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-CONGRESS.jpg,"Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), center, speaks with reporters as he departs the Senate floor on Tuesday.

Democrats were outnumbered, obviously, and she no longer had the power to impose her will the way she did when she was speaker of the House. But neither did the current speaker, John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). <br><br> With a partial Department of Homeland Security shutdown looming, Pelosi saw a way to torpedo Boehner, and get exactly what she and other Democrats wanted for President Obama. The plan was simple: When Boehner needed her the most, she would not be there for him. <br><br> She explained her plan to Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) in a private meeting in Reid’s office. He concurred. She encouraged her caucus to reject Boehner’s proposal for a stopgap DHS funding bill, knowing that Boehner could not sufficiently rally his own caucus to pass the bill without Democratic help. <br><br> Five days later, Democrats got exactly what they wanted: DHS was fully funded without any rollback of Obama’s executive actions on immigration. <br><br> Four months after getting kicked to the curb in the November midterm elections, Democrats across the country are still licking their wounds, quarreling over the party’s direction and messily plotting their path back to power in 2016. But inside the halls of Congress, they aren’t acting like a dejected minority. <br><br> [Boehner’s problem isn’t just House Republicans. It’s House Democrats, too.] <br><br> Instead, House Minority Leader Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Reid have been deftly navigating the big legislative debates to maximum advantage, thwarting the new majorities’ early ambitions and protecting Obama from the GOP assaults on his agenda. <br><br> Their strategy? Stick together when the other side doesn’t. It sounds simple enough. But it wasn’t always clear to Democratic leaders that they could pull it off. <br><br> “When we first got back in January, everyone was pretty depressed,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the third-ranking Senate Democrat. The party had just lost its Senate majority and watched Republicans claim their largest House majority in decades. <br><br> Republicans doubt Democrats can hold their members together as well in future debates in which there is more potential for fracturing. They charge that Democrats shut down debate over DHS funding and are moving to protect Obama’s agenda at all costs. <br><br> But Democrats see the DHS fight as a win they can build upon that had roots in a separate matter. In the Senate, the pivotal party unity moment came in late January during the debate over construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, according to several Democrats. The weekend after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) opted not to hold votes on some Democratic amendments, Reid and his top deputies called rank-and-file senators to gauge whether they would have enough support to block the bill’s progress the following Monday. <br><br> What they found was Democratic frustration with the GOP’s tactics. They capitalized, keeping McConnell short of the 60 votes he needed to advance the measure under Senate rules. It was the first major blow to the unified Republican majority. <br><br> “We don’t have 60 votes. So as long as they stay together, they will have an influence,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). <br><br> Keystone passed later that week after Democrats got to voice the input they sought, and the bill later cleared the House. But Obama vetoed the measure, and Senate Democrats prevented Republicans from overriding him. <br><br> [Obama’s Keystone veto will stand after Senate vote fails] <br><br> In the House, the DHS funding debate united a Democratic caucus that had shown signs of discord. Last December, tensions between liberals and moderates flared up over provisions tucked into a $1.1 trillion government funding measure that made a concession to large banks and enhanced the power of wealthy political donors. <br><br> A crucial day was Feb. 26, when Pelosi and Reid huddled in Reid’s office to talk strategy just before a joint news conference. Later that day, Pelosi and her top deputies agreed to ask rank-and-file Democrats to hold their votes until the end on a DHS funding bill House Republicans were about to unveil. <br><br> “Let’s enhance our own power in this thing, because this is a culmination of a lot of things coming together, whether it’s immigration, whether it’s anti-Obama,” Pelosi said in a meeting with members the next morning, according to Democrats in the room. She said Reid was on board but that if the House didn’t stop it, the bill could pass the Senate. <br><br> Boehner sold his three-week stopgap bill to Republicans as a way to avoid a looming DHS shutdown and continue to push for a longer-term funding bill that would also fight Obama on immigration. A combination of dozens of conservative Republicans who weren’t sold on Boehner’s plan and all but 12 Democrats who voted kept it from passing. <br><br> “When it became obvious that the Republicans were divided,” said House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), Democrats saw a “real opportunity to defeat the Republican strategy.” <br><br> Hoyer and his whip team approached the Democratic rank-and-file within an hour of concluding Republicans would release a three-week bill, according to a Democratic leadership aide. They reached out to members on the House floor as well as through phone calls and staff, said the aide, who was granted anonymity to describe strategy. <br><br> The Senate had passed its own long-term DHS funding bill with no immigration provisions that same day. By the evening, Reid had already gone home to the Ritz-Carlton — he would later return — and Democratic Senate aides were bracing for a long night over dinner from Chipotle. <br><br> But after a flurry of phone calls involving top congressional leaders, Democrats say they became convinced that if they helped pass a one-week stopgap bill, they would get a House vote on the “clean” Senate bill. <br><br> Boehner’s office denies he ever guaranteed that would happen. But Democrats whipped votes for the one-week bill with the promise that it would give them what they sought. It passed. <br><br> Then on Tuesday, the House passed the Senate’s “clean” bill. Every House Democrat who voted supported it. <br><br> Democrats’ unity-above-all-else strategy isn’t exactly new. Boehner and McConnell took a similar approach six years ago when their caucuses were relegated to their smallest minority status in a generation. Boehner got every House Republican to oppose Obama’s stimulus plan, and McConnell did the same on his health-care law. The hope was to cast the legislation as sharply partisan. <br><br> Democratic leaders are hoping to head off future dissent by reminding the rank-and-file of what they saw in the DHS standoff: They hold the cards in big fights when they are united and Republicans are in disarray. <br><br> “We’re learning pretty quickly how to operate in the minority on key votes,” Schumer said. <br><br> sean.sullivan@washpost.com <br><br> Paul Kane contributed to this report. <br><br>",06/03/2015,0:56:00,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/05/National-Politics/Images/Was8907656-3604.jpg,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Senator Harry M.

13,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/10/democrats-prepare-for-filibuster-summer/,Democrats prepare for filibuster summer,Kelsey Snell; Paul Kane,blog,Politics,PowerPost,"After almost six months in the minority, Charles E. Schumer says Senate Democrats aren’t afraid to be obstructionists, detailing a strategy of blocking appropriations bills and other Republican agenda items until they get what they want. <br><br> Democrats are quickly learning that their only leverage point on Capitol Hill is through Senate unity, and in a wide-ranging interview, Schumer (D-N.Y.) said they are joining President Obama behind a plan to try to force Republicans to the negotiating table over everything from domestic and defense spending to highway funding and international tax reform.  <br><br> Get ready for filibuster summer. <br><br> “There is pretty close to unanimity in our caucus that we are not going to just vote on individual appropriations bills until we have a plan as to how much overall money we’re going to spend and where that money is going to be allocated,” said Schumer, a member of party leadership. <br><br> Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post’s new political tipsheet <br><br> Schumer’s words reflect his reputation as a pugnacious partisan who takes on battles he thinks will resonate with voters. They may also foreshadow his style as the likely future Senate Democratic leader when Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the current holder of that title, retires at the end of this Congress. His advisers note, however, that in addition to his four years as a brutally successful campaign chief, he has also spent recent years working with Republicans on some key bipartisan measures including immigration and Senate rules. <br><br> The White House-backed plan to get Republicans to support more spending for domestic programs by blocking floor consideration of appropriations bills was developed in a series of closed-door meetings held over the course of several weeks. <br><br> Schumer, joined by Reid and Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin, (D-Ill.), set out in recent days to rebound from weeks of party division over White House-backed trade legislation to sell the image of Democrats as a single, unbreakable force. <br><br> He said his colleagues are resolute and will not buckle when Republicans soon test their unity by bringing up for votes popular defense and veterans spending bills. <br><br> “We want to get a large agreement which the White House and the leadership of both parties in Congress buys off on,” Schumer said. “We’re not going to let them just cherry-pick and say we’ll give you a nice big number for defense and a nice big number for, say, veterans and energy and water and at the end of the day say, well, there’s not much left for HHS, take it or leave it.” <br><br> At issue is how to deal with the spending caps, known as the sequester, that were negotiated as part of the 2011 Budget Control Act and took effect in early 2013. Republicans have found a way to address their concerns about the impact of these funding restrictions on the military by tapping a war funding account for extra dollars, but Democrats are pressing for the caps to be boosted for domestic spending programs as well. <br><br> To maintain their leverage, Democrats have decided to block all spending bills starting with the defense appropriations measure headed to the floor next week. Durbin told reporters on Tuesday that there is also no ruling out a blockade of program authorizations, like upcoming votes on highway funding. <br><br> Democrats hope the plan will force Republicans to negotiate solutions to a series of expiring programs that Schumer calls “mini-cliffs,” recalling the the 2012 fiscal cliff breakdown where Democrats ultimately won $600 billion in tax increases on the wealthy. <br><br> The cliffs begin on June 30 when authorization for the Export-Import Bank is set to expire. By July 31, lawmakers will again be forced to fund a gap in the Highway Trust Fund before heading out of town for a month-long August recess. When they return, they will have one month before funding for the federal government runs out on Sept. 30, not long before the Treasury Department expects lawmakers will need to increase the debt limit. <br><br> The ball is already in Republicans’ court. The first test of the strategy came when Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) agreed last month to support trade legislation that gives the White House extensive bargaining power in exchange for a promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) of a vote on extending the Export-Import Bank’s charter. <br><br> Democrats said the deal, cut on the floor of the Senate amid a tense vote for the trade bill, ensures a vote on the bank and not in connection with a bill that the president has threatened to veto. But weeks later, they have seen little evidence that McConnell will follow through. <br><br> “You’d think that when there’s a promise that’s made out there and it was made on the floor, as I understand it, that they’d stick with it,” Schumer said. “The positive way to look at it is they intend to stick by their promise; they just haven’t figured out how.” <br><br> But blocking the appropriations bills outright goes one step further to undermine a vow from McConnell to once again fund the government through regular order. After weeks of battle over government spying programs and trade legislation, a breakdown on appropriations could end the narrative that Republicans have ushered in a new gridlock-free era of legislating in Congress. <br><br> The plan to block votes on spending bills also opens Democrats to charges of hypocrisy. They spent years deriding Republican delaying tactics as being obstructionist before now warming to the idea when it’s the best strategy for influencing the congressional agenda. <br><br> Republicans are still skeptical that this new brand of Democratic unity will hold when the funding bills are actually up for consideration. <br><br> “Senator Reid had previously said he was even going to block this defense authorization bill from coming to the floor,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters on Tuesday. “He said it was a waste of time, but it is on the floor now, and I expect that we’re going to be able to pass it with Democratic support as well.” <br><br> Beyond the immediate fight, Schumer said he is still working with Republicans on an international corporate tax reform proposal that he says could be the only policy area where bipartisan agreement remains. <br><br> “There might be a decent chance that there is something to be done on tax reform,” he said. “For Democrats, it would have to be linked to transportation.” <br><br> Schumer is the co-chairman of a bipartisan working group on tax reform with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). They have been working since January to craft a proposal they could sell in both the House and the Senate. Aides close to the process say the two are making significant progress. <br><br> Republicans would get a more business-friendly international tax code, and Democrats would be able to use money from transitioning to the new system to help pay for a large portion of the Highway Trust Fund. <br><br> But even that plan comes with serious caveats, making a deal a long shot at best. <br><br> “There are many on this side saying no infrastructure if we’re going to do corporate tax reform,” Schumer said. “And the president has said you won’t get corporate tax reform without infrastructure.” <br><br> All this plotting by Democratic leadership will be for naught if members feel the pressure to break ranks and support some spending bills and other must-pass legislation. <br><br> Schumer says he’s not worried <br><br> “We’re singing from the same page,” he said. “Democrats are unified.” <br><br>",10/06/2015,4:00:21,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/03/Local/Images/schumer0051433369591.jpg,"Sen.

12,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congressional-republicans-turn-focus-to-gas-prices/2012/04/15/gIQAZew3JT_story.html,Congressional Republicans turn focus to gas prices,Paul Kane,article,Politics,Politics,"Free of the GOP presidential primaries that frequently forced their agenda onto the sidelines in favor of social issues, congressional Republicans return to Washington on Monday refocusing on bread-and-butter matters, particularly high gasoline prices. <br><br> Returning from a two-week break Monday, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) wants the spring legislative session to focus on several bills to allow more domestic energy exploration, believing that the issue has become an Achilles’ heel for President Obama. <br><br> Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are forcing a vote Monday on the so-called Buffett rule, in which those earning more than $1 million a year would require a minimum tax of 30 percent even on the sort of investment income that billionaires such as Warren Buffett use to reap most of their money. <br><br> For Democrats, this is part of their effort to campaign on a message of economic fairness, suggesting that Republicans hide behind deregulating oil drilling and natural gas exploration as a paean to multibillion-dollar energy companies. But Republicans counter that the issue of high gas costs connects more viscerally with voters in tough economic times. <br><br> Starting this week, the House GOP will try to push a temporary highway funding bill that includes mandatory approval of construction of the Keystone energy pipeline, setting up a negotiation showdown with the Senate. In addition, committees are moving bills that would freeze regulations on refineries and also forbid Obama from releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep costs down, a move that Republicans say would only be done for political expediency as the November election draws near. <br><br> “Gas prices have doubled on President Obama’s watch, and the American people are asking why he and Senate Democrats are blocking more American energy production,” Boehner said in a statement. “Whether the president joins us or not, we will continue to fight for common-sense solutions that lower gas prices and create new jobs.” <br><br> Republicans believe that the winter surge in energy costs — the average price of a gallon of gas jumped nearly 70 cents, to about $3.90, from late December to mid-April — provides them with a political opening to go on the offensive against Obama. <br><br> Perhaps sensitive to the criticism, the White House announced Friday that it was forming a working group with representatives from a dozen agencies to coordinate oversight of drilling, with an emphasis on natural gas exploration and its controversial technique known as “fracking.” Republicans have argued that it is a cheap, readily available technique to get more energy sources here at home. They dismiss the working group as just another study that would not deal with the immediate energy needs. <br><br> Senate Democrats reject the House highway plan as pointless and believe Boehner should allow a vote on their bipartisan highway plan that won nearly 80 votes, providing for better roads and helping spur jobs. <br><br> “If Republicans are serious about putting people back to work, they will pass the Senate’s bipartisan highway bill rather than bog it down further with political add-ons,” said Brian Fallon, spokesman for Senate Democrats, rejecting the Keystone issue as something that Obama has said needs further study. <br><br> In addition, Democratic strategists note that gas prices have held steady the past few weeks and may be ready to drop some, possibly taking steam out of the Republican argument. <br><br> GOP pollster David Winston said the last concerted campaign by Republicans on the cost of gasoline, in the summer of 2008, came when the economy was still considered relatively good — in August 2008 the unemployment rate was 6.1 percent. <br><br> Now, Winston said, “there is a real economic dynamic that didn’t exist then.” His most recent poll, which is being distributed to Boehner’s GOP conference, shows that congressional Republicans hold a seven-point edge, 48 percent to 41 percent, over Obama on how they are handling the energy issue. More importantly, independent voters side with Republicans, 47 percent to 32 percent, by a wider margin. <br><br> So long as Republicans can connect the gas price issue to the broader economy, they have an edge over Democrats, particularly because voters appear to favor a two-pronged approach of more drilling now and pushing for alternative energy sources for the future, Winston said. “There’s a much more realistic sense of we’ve got to meet present energy needs.” <br><br> Obama, using something Boehner coined in 2008, has talked about an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy issues, but it has not entirely sunk in with the public. <br><br> Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, pitched his legislation to stop new regulations on refineries in Saturday’s GOP response to the weekly presidential address — the seventh such GOP response in the last eight weeks to discuss gas prices. He called lower gas prices “essential to job creation and economic recovery.” <br><br> “We’re knocking at the door of a brighter energy future; one that promises abundant, secure and cheaper North American supplies, as long as Washington doesn’t create artificial obstacles,” Upton said. “That is what Republicans are working toward, and we invite the president to join us.” <br><br>",15/04/2012,17:15:42,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/04/15/National-Politics/Images/142063097.jpg," U.S. Speaker of the House Rep.

The effort has revived hope among advocates that a bipartisan deal can be reached to address the fate of the nation’s 11 million undocumented workers and students. <br><br> The chances of a comprehensive deal passing Congress remain doubtful, advocates cautioned, and they worry that the legislative process will spill into 2014, presenting new complications in a year when lawmakers face reelection battles. <br><br> But they were encouraged by signals from key GOP leaders that the House is willing to move forward on legislation that could produce a breakthrough in the stalled negotiations. <br><br> Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said Thursday that his panel is working on four new pieces of legislation dealing with border-control laws. He did not disclose details but emphasized the need to resolve the status of people living in the country illegally. <br><br> “We want to do immigration reform right,” Goodlatte told about 70 Hispanic leaders during a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill, adding that he hopes the House can begin considering bills next month. <br><br> The state of U.S. immigration See how immigration trends have shifted over the years. <br><br> His remarks boosted the spirits of advocates who have become increasingly fretful that Republicans have been dragging out the process in an effort to kill momentum for a deal. <br><br> The Democratic-controlled Senate approved a bipartisan plan in June that features a 13-year path to citizenship for immigrants who are in the country illegally, the key sticking point for many House Republicans. <br><br> From the beginning, the chances of a comprehensive deal in the House have been remote. An attempt to replicate the Senate’s broad approach foundered last week when two more House Republicans dropped out of bipartisan talks. Instead, GOP leaders have said they will pursue a series of smaller bills. <br><br> Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) told immigration advocates in a private conversation this month that the issue remains on the agenda despite a crowded calendar that also includes negotiations on the budget and the debt ceiling, according to a person familiar with the discussions. <br><br> “I’m optimistic the House will get to the package” of immigration bills, said Kevin Appleby, director of migration policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is pushing for a deal. “Indications from Representative Goodlatte and others are that they want to move on immigration, that doing nothing is not an option. I am of the belief, despite reports that immigration reform is dead, that it’s very much alive.” <br><br> Goodlatte, whose committee oversees immigration legislation, has said he is open to granting legal status to otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants. He and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) are reportedly working on a bill that would grant such status to young people who were brought to the country illegally by their parents. <br><br> However, Goodlatte has said he does not support a “special path” that would give immigrants who broke the law to enter the country preferential treatment over other foreigners in pursuing citizenship. Once granted legal status, those immigrants could apply for citizenship through existing channels, Goodlatte has said. <br><br> “A lot comes down to nuance,” said an aide to another GOP House member, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk on the record. “A ‘special pathway’ is a term a lot of Republicans don’t like.” <br><br> By contrast, the Senate bill would guarantee that most undocumented immigrants could earn green cards in 10 years, and citizenship three years after that, if they paid fines, learned English, remained employed and did not commit crimes. <br><br> How clear that path to citizenship is promises to be the crucial debate in the House. The Obama administration and Senate Democrats have said they will not support a plan that does not offer illegal immigrants a clear path to becoming citizens, because that would risk creating a legalized underclass. <br><br> Alfonso Aguilar, the executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles and the moderator of the GOP’s roundtable last week, said he believes that House Republicans are sincere in their pledge to move forward. <br><br> “I just hope that if Democrats want to get this done, they wouldn’t kill a bill that provides legal status just because they have to have a ‘special path’ to citizenship,” Aguilar said. “That would show they are playing politics.” <br><br> Some Democrats fear that House Republicans are not serious about passing bills to address the fate of the undocumented. A Democratic Senate aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, said Friday that when it comes to what Goodlatte’s committee will endorse on the question of citizenship, the “devil is in the details.” If the committee, and the full House, can produce a bill that offers at least some illegal immigrants a chance at citizenship, this aide said, then the leaders of the two chambers could engage in a conference aimed at negotiating a compromise. <br><br> However, House conservatives are skeptical of a conference because they fear that the leadership would agree to a more liberal bill than they want in an effort to move the issue off the agenda for the 2016 presidential race. Latinos overwhelmingly supported President Obama’s reelection last fall. <br><br> Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who led the negotiations on the Senate plan, acknowledged that the debate over the budget has slowed progress on immigration. But he said he remains “hopeful that there are enough Republicans in the House who want to get something done that we can get a bill this year.” <br><br> Advocates have said they will continue to pressure the House, emphasizing that Republicans’ electoral troubles will only get worse if they do not act, since Latinos and Asians are among the fastest-growing voting blocs. <br><br> House GOP leaders posted a video on YouTube last week to kick off Hispanic Heritage Month in which Boehner, Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) hail the contributions of Hispanic Americans. <br><br> But the video drew angry comments from viewers upset that it made no mention of immigration, and a Miami advocacy group quickly produced a parody video mocking House Republicans for what it saw as pandering. <br><br>",22/09/2013,16:02:20,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/05/15/Others/Images/2013-05-15/HOLDER30031368648251.jpg,House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said Thursday that his panel is working on new legislation dealing with border control.

Blue states California and Oregon are both projected to gain seats, as are swing states Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. <br><br> But states most likely to lose seats are almost all reliably Democratic: Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island — all states Democratic presidential candidates have carried in the last six national elections — are projected to lose enough population to shed a seat. <br><br> Swing Ohio is projected to drop a seat, and Alabama and West Virginia, both states Republicans have won in the last four national elections, would also lose seats. <br><br> That means blue states would lose a net of four electoral votes, and red states would gain a net of two, a shift of six total electoral votes, the equivalent of flipping a state the size of Iowa from the blue column to the red column. <br><br> “While Democrats are making inroads in the South and Mountain West, these aren’t occurring fast enough to make up for apportionment losses due to population shifts,” said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institute. “Texas continues to be the mega migration magnet for the nation, and, if that continues, the Republicans have a strong card in their deck in the future.” <br><br> The Bureau’s estimates are preliminary, and population trends could easily shift in the six years before the 2020 Census. Before the 2010 Census, the economic recession dramatically slowed down migration patterns and prevented some states from losing seats. <br><br> “We are only at the midpoint of the decade, and a lot of things could change before the next Census is taken in 2020,” said Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services. “It’s important to remember that major events like [Hurricane] Katrina and the 2008 recession each changed population growth patterns and that impacted and changed the next apportionment.” <br><br> But current projections show some states are just inches, population-wise, from retaining, gaining or losing seats. Rhode Island is a little more than 21,000 residents from falling below the threshold they need to keep their second Congressional seat, which the state has maintained since losing its third seat after the 1930 Census. <br><br> Oregon must add 53,000 residents to gain their sixth district. One projection shows Virginia gaining a seat by the narrowest of margins, about 14,000 residents — about two-tenths of the state’s population. <br><br> The U.S. Constitution grants every state at least one member of the House of Representatives, and additional members based on population. Demographers are able to use Census data to project which state would get which seat in Congress — for example, if Congress were made up of just 51 members, California, the nation’s largest state by population, would be awarded the 51st seat. <br><br> Under the current projections, Virginia would be awarded the 435th seat. Alabama would just miss out: They would keep their seventh seat if Congress expanded to 436 members. <br><br> The smallest state, Wyoming, would only be awarded a second seat if Congress expanded to 746 members. Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R) represents fewer constituents, 613,606, than any other member of Congress, according to current Census population estimates. <br><br> Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke (R) still represents the largest number of constituents, at just under 1.1 million. Montana would gain a second member of Congress if the House expanded by just four seats, to 439 members. <br><br> The long-term reapportionment trend shows greater growth in Southern and Western states over a century. California has gained seats in every decennial reapportionment process since 1860, except in the 2010 cycle. Texas has gained at least one seat every decade since 1950. <br><br> On the other hand, New York’s Congressional delegation has shrunk precipitously, from a peak of 45 seats after the 1930 Census to just 27 after reapportionment in 2010. Ohio’s delegation has plummeted from 24 seats after 1930 to just 16 today, and Pennsylvania’s has been cut in half, from 36 seats after the 1910 Census to 18 today. <br><br> See the historical size of each state’s delegation here, courtesy EDS. <br><br>",23/01/2015,5:00:27,https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2015/01/reapp.png,"States projected to gain and lose Congressional seats in the next Census, according to mid-decade population estimates.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) can't come to a deal on expanded background checks sometime in the next few days, President Obama's gun legislation is headed toward a filibuster led by some of the Senate's most conservative members. <br><br> Politically speaking, such a move could have short-term benefits for Republicans but also creates real risks for further damage to the party's already tarnished brand in the long(er) term. <br><br> “The delay is ok if the Senate invokes cloture,” said former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis (R). “If issue is killed in filibuster then we are in deep trouble.” (Cloture would mean that a vote would occur on whether to end debate.) <br><br> Ove the weekend, Arizona Sen. John McCain warned against the idea of a filibuster, which has been floated by the likes of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio among others. ""The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand,"" McCain said. ""What are we afraid of?"" <br><br> Defenders of the idea of a filibuster on guns insist that the 2014 political calculations mean that there is little risk to their side if the legislation doesn't make it. ""You have to take it out of a national context and put it into a midterm viewpoint to make an adequate political assessment,"" explained one senior Republican Senate strategist. ""In the states that matter in 2014, and the states currently held by GOP Senators, there is not a lot of liability in defeating a gun control bill. How it is defeated is probably irrelevant."" <br><br> A look at the map proves that out.  Of the 14 seats that Republicans are defending in 2014, just one -- Maine -- is in a state that President Obama won in 2012. Contrast that with five Democratic incumbents up in 2014 in states Mitt Romney won as well as two open seats in South Dakota and West Virginia where Romney prevailed, and you begin to see how the near-term politics may well not punish (and might even reward) those who put down a gun control law. <br><br> But, what's good politics for Republicans in South Dakota or Nebraska or Mississippi is not necessarily a good thing for the GOP's attempts to rebrand itself.  Remember that expanded background checks have the support of roughly nine in ten Americans -- a sort of no-brainer issue that typically guarantees congressional action of some sort. <br><br> If Republicans kill gun control measures that are widely popular via the filibuster they run the very real risk of alienating many of the right-leaning independents and centrists that they badly need to win back in advance of the 2016 presidential election. <br><br> Davis' argument -- outlined above -- is the right one. Forcing more discussion of the Senate guns bill before ultimately allowing a cloture vote to shut off debate and move toward a final vote is entirely defensible from a policy and political perspective. <br><br> ""For conservatives, the unease about a robust government which always generously interprets its power to investigate, regulate, legislate and litigate is longstanding, and looking for the time to talk this over gives them the best chance to lay their principles before constituents and the general public, so that in the end, voters may disagree with a specific politician but nevertheless respect the stand that she took,"" explained Eric Ueland, a former top aide to then Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.). <br><br> All true. But if an up or down vote isn't allowed -- even for cloture -- the dynamic changes. All of a sudden Republicans become the party defined by their use of a Senate rule that virtually no one understands to shut down a bill that, at least in its component parts, a large majority of Americans favor. <br><br> For a party who is commonly regarded as ""inflexible"" and ""unwilling to compromise"" being seen as the side that ended gun control without even a vote further addd to a very negative perception of the GOP. Opposing gun control on 2nd Amendment grounds is one thing. (""If Republicans are not the party associated with protecting the 2nd amendment, we’ve got nothing,"" said a veteran GOP operative with close ties to the Senate.)  Using the rules of the Senate to block a vote, however, is something entirely different. <br><br> Senate Republicans would do well to remember the difference between the two paths if/when the Toomey-Manchin talks break down and the attention turns to the possibility of a GOP filibuster. <br><br>",08/04/2013,10:42:31,https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2013/04/guns.jpg,South Carolina Sen.

That is more than double the $5 million that the NRCC, the committee charged with electing Republicans to the House, raised in the last February of a non-election year. <br><br> That haul follows another record month for the NRCC in January, in which the committee raised $10 million. That outpaced the committee’s counterparts at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who reported raising $7.8 million in January. <br><br> “Republicans are determined to deliver on the promises we made to the American people, and these historic fundraising numbers are a testament to their belief in our ability to execute on their behalf,” said Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the NRCC’s chairman. “With record fundraising totals for two straight months, there is simply no denying that Republican momentum is building for 2018.” <br><br> Although Trump has played little direct role in congressional fundraising, it is unified GOP control in Washington — and the legislative possibilities it presents — that probably has made the party’s big donors more willing than ever to open up their wallets and purses to elect House Republicans. <br><br> House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) played a big role in beefing up the NRCC’s numbers, transferring $4.4 million from his joint fundraising committee last month. <br><br> “House Republicans ran on a very specific plan to get our country back on track, and now with a unified Republican government we have an opportunity to deliver on those big promises,” said Kevin Seifert, Ryan’s chief political adviser. “This is an exciting time, and the level of support for the Republican agenda has been simply staggering.” <br><br> The House fundraising numbers are especially crucial, considering that Democrats see the House — not the Senate — as their best opportunity to retake power in Washington in 2018. The DCCC has yet to announce its February fundraising numbers, but it did tout a record month for grass-roots fundraising on Tuesday, including $4.7 million in online donations and $1.8 million through direct mail and phone calls. <br><br> Democrats point to the unprecedented number of small donors as proof of increased Democratic political engagement driven by Trump’s victory — engagement they are hoping to harness to help unseat Republicans next year. The NRCC does not typically separately report its digital fundraising numbers, and the February numbers released Wednesday do not break out small donors. <br><br> “The massive growth in our base of grass-roots donors will continue to benefit our committee and our candidates as we work to maximize gains on an expanded battlefield,” DCCC spokesman Tyler Law said Tuesday. <br><br>",08/03/2017,6:00:32,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-03-07/Reuters/2017-03-08T001224Z_1928648096_RC1BF3A6B700_RTRMADP_3_USA-OBAMACARE.jpg,"House Speaker Paul D.

Ryan (R-Wis.) and Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning at the Republican National Committee to expect a difficult political landscape ahead of the midterm congressional elections next year. They cited increased grass-roots engagement on the left and robust fundraising for Democratic candidates in recent special elections in urging lawmakers to accelerate their own political efforts in response. <br><br> “The message from leadership, and I think it’s a very appropriate message, is: We are not going to take anything for granted,” said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), a key GOP fundraiser. “Even in the districts that lean or tilt heavily Republican, you have to be ready — you can’t just sit around and expect that this is just going to roll your way without some major effort. This will be a year Republicans will need to recognize that getting this majority was hard, and keeping it is hard, and we need to roll up our sleeves and do everything necessary so the day after Election Day, we’re not sitting around playing the what-if game.” <br><br> According to the most recent publicly reported figures available, Republicans are getting outspent by Democrats in the key congressional battleground of 2017 — Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, where Democrat Jon Ossoff has raised a staggering $23.6 million in his bid to claim the House seat once held by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Republican candidate Karen Handel has lagged with $4.5 million raised, although that has been boosted by a $6.3 million commitment from the NRCC and $7 million in planned spending from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC. <br><br> Small donors have also pumped millions into Democratic campaigns waging recent special elections in Kansas and Montana, forcing the NRCC and Republican-aligned outside groups to spend millions to blunt the impact of the grass-roots surge on the left. In both cases, Republican candidates won — but by slimmer margins than the GOP has come to expect in those particular districts. <br><br> Inside the meeting, Stivers gave House Republicans an update on the Georgia race and another pending special election in South Carolina, telling them that Republicans were in position to win both races — citing polling showing a dead heat in Georgia and a solid GOP advantage in South Carolina. <br><br> But he also warned that the NRCC has already spent roughly $10 million on special elections in 2017 — far outstripping the committee’s spending in other recent nonelection years. From 2009 through 2016, the committee spent about $9.7 million combined on special elections. <br><br> In an interview Tuesday, Stivers said he simply reiterated sage advice for any election cycle — “You always need to be ready for every race” — and said he felt good about how House Republicans were positioned, with the party committee outraising its Democratic counterpart. <br><br> “If you are ready, everything will be good, and we always need to be ready,” he said. “I don’t feel any doom or gloom whatsoever. I’m excited about this cycle.” <br><br> Ryan, a person inside the meeting said, emphasized the need for members — even those in safe seats — to prepare for what’s ahead by increasing their own fundraising pace and potentially by assisting colleagues in tougher races by transferring money to the NRCC. Several members announced contributions to the party committee on the spot. <br><br> Multiple members inside the Tuesday morning meeting said the challenge was also presented in historical terms: Parties in power tend to lose ground in the midterm congressional elections. <br><br> “The average midterm turnover is 32 seats since FDR,” said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.). “So you’ve got to be paying attention to those things — get out there, work hard, work on your messaging.” <br><br> The potential challenges for GOP House candidates, both now and in 2018, are myriad — starting with an unpopular president mired in investigations that are unlikely to be resolved soon, which stands to turn off independent voters, to a congressional majority that has been unable so far to swiftly execute its agenda, which could dampen enthusiasm on the right. Those obstacles could weigh even heavier if Ossoff beats Handel on June 20, demonstrating concrete momentum for Democrats. <br><br> Stivers said he was not concerned about the Georgia race, citing tight polls and encouraging early-voting turnout for Republicans, and he made a case that an Ossoff win still wouldn’t spell disaster for the GOP. <br><br> “I give him fundraising props, but that’s a single race,” Stivers said. “This isn’t something they can duplicate, even in Georgia-six. In a general in 2018, they can’t raise $20 million, because there will be 435 seats to talk about, not one.” <br><br> Womack said he, too, was wary of reading too much into the special election results, and he said the historical record on midterm elections could be of limited utility. <br><br> “I don’t know how you can apply historical averages because of the way redistricting has happened over the last four, five decades,” he said. “We’ve created a lot of pretty safe seats out there.” <br><br> But he said that the political head winds for Republicans were unmistakable. <br><br> “It’s on everybody’s mind: I mean, we know what we’re facing, and we know that the other side of the aisle is motivated, their ground game is going to be good,” Womack said. “The ’18 cycle is going to be our first real test out of the box after a change in administration, so we know we have to do our jobs. We have to be fundamentally sound. We need to have our game face on every day, and we need to be developing the right resources and doing the job that is expected of somebody that’s up for reelection.” <br><br>",13/06/2017,11:09:09,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-06-13/Getty/695587510.jpg,House Speaker Paul D.

Barbara Comstock (Va.), Will Hurd (Tex.), Steve Knight (Calif.) and David Valadao (Calif.). Five others are freshmen who prevailed last year in swing districts: Reps. John Faso (N.Y.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Jason Lewis (Minn.), Brian Mast (Fla.) and Claudia Tenney (N.Y.). The tenth is a House veteran, Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.), who barely eked out a victory in an increasingly competitive San Diego-area district. <br><br> Those 10 all appear on a list of 59 targeted seats released last month by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Fitzpatrick, Hurd, Issa, Lewis and Tenney also represent districts where the DCCC is already hiring field operatives to do organizing work ahead of 2018. <br><br> Patriot Program participants posted an impressive batting average in 2016: Of the 20 candidates named to the program in the last cycle, only three — Bob Dold (Ill.), Frank Guinta (N.H.), and Cresent Hardy (Nev.) — lost their general election races. A fourth, Dan Benishek (Mich.), chose to retire and was replaced by a fellow Republican. <br><br> Notably absent from the initial list of this year’s NRCC Patriots are a handful of Republican members who were included in the 2016 program and were expected to endure tough reelection challenges in 2016 but ended up winning relatively handily — such as Reps. Carlos Curbelo (Fla.), Martha McSally (Ariz.), Bruce Poliquin (Maine) and Lee Zeldin (N.Y.). Also in that category is Rep. John Katko (N.Y.), who now chairs the Patriot program under NRCC chairman Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), and more participants could be added later. <br><br> “Our Patriots are a group of battle-tested members who won hard-fought races in 2016 and are ready to win once again,” Stivers said in a statement. “Each of these members is not only an effective member in Congress, but an integral advocate for the communities they serve.

The petition must get 218 signatures to force a vote on the legislation. <br><br> ""We're asking them to put their pen where their mouth is,"" said Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. <br><br> The discharge petition strategy is complicated, and rarely successful.  <br><br> The House Democratic caucus includes 199 members — 19 short of the votes needed for a petition to succeed. No House Republicans have said they plan to sign the petition and buck party leaders. <br><br> Still, Democratic House members point to the fact that as many as 30 Republicans have said previously that they would vote for an immigration reform bill that includes a pathway to citizenship. <br><br> ""There are enough votes to get this done,"" said Rep. Joe Garcia (D-Fla.). ""There is a deaf ear. His name is John Boehner."" <br><br> House Republican leadership has repeatedly said that it would like to take up immigration reform, but some conservatives have declared that a vote on such a bill would doom the GOP in the midterms, throwing cold water on the idea that they would bring up the bill for a vote prior to the election. <br><br> ""The other way we can bring a bill forward is to go around the speaker,"" Polis said. <br><br> While the prospects of securing a vote on the proposed immigration reform legislation through discharge petition seem unlikely, Democrats note that it is important to show they've exhausted all options to press for the reforms — theoretically affording political cover to President Obama were he to implement reforms via executive order. <br><br> Still, Democrats say they'd ideally like to see reforms passed through Congress. <br><br> ""There is only one way to fix these issues permanently,"" said Rep. Steven Horsford, (D-Nev.). ""And that's with a legislative action."" <br><br> Democratic aides have also noted that the push for the discharge petition is in large part to mobilize outside groups and build pressure on the House leadership to bring up the bill for a vote. Meanwhile — believing that immigration could become a flashpoint in a handful of competitive races in Arizona, California, Colorado, Texas and Florida, where the issue resonates — Democrats hope that voters will punish Republicans at the ballot box if the GOP refuses to allow a vote. <br><br>",15/04/2014,10:09:41,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/23/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Was8406822.jpg,"Activists hold signs and family photos protesting U.S. immigration policy in Lafayette Square outside the White House on March 12, 2014, in Washington, D.C.  (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images) <br><br>",Wesley Lowery is a national reporter covering law enforcement and justice for the Washington Post.

Instead, politicians on both sides appeared emboldened and had a similar message: The fault lies elsewhere for the disruptions that the closures will produce. <br><br> President Obama, who once hoped to mark Tuesday as the day when critical elements of his Affordable Care Act took effect, instead used part of his time at a public event in the White House Rose Garden to lob rhetorical grenades at the Republicans for what he described as their intransigence and dereliction of duty. <br><br> Obama said defiantly that his health-care law, which is the sole reason the government is partly shuttered and the political system in the capital paralyzed, is “here to stay,” no matter what Republicans think of it or try to do to it. He appeared more peeved than outright angry about the state of things. <br><br> On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats traded accusations for Congress’s failure to find a way to fund the government for two more months — an act that, even if it had been done, would hardly be something to crow about. Such limited ambitions — asking lawmakers in essence to punt for 60 or so more days, when another round of squabbling presumably would occur — underscore the breakdown of the system. <br><br> House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), in a USA Today op-ed, accused Obama of a “scorched-Earth policy of refusing to negotiate” over health care, spending or entitlement reform and said that was why the government ended up closed. <br><br> Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) sat with other House Republicans named to a budget conference committee that had been rejected out of hand by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) just before the shutdown began. <br><br> Cantor condemned the Democrats for refusing even to discuss what he said were repeated efforts by his party to offer different formulas to break the stalemate. The reality, of course, given the raw numbers in the House and the Senate, is that in trying to use a short-term funding bill to stop or delay Obamacare, the Republicans ended up stopping the government. <br><br> Reid continued to insist that Senate Democrats would never yield until the Republicans abandoned their strings-attached strategy and sent him a clean bill to fund the government. Reid’s dismissals of the Republican tactics grow more flagrant and inflammatory by the day, which is not likely to serve Democrats well in the long run. <br><br> Democrats had hoped that Republicans would feel heat the closer they came to missing the deadline to keep the government running. If anything, calls for Republicans to stay the course were even louder on Tuesday than they were on Monday. <br><br> The Weekly Standard summed up this hard-line approach with a posting that compared the GOP’s situation to someone in a game of blackjack. Better to stay put for now with a not-so-great hand than move precipitously and end up a clear loser. “That’s the Republicans’ situation today,” wrote William Kristol, the magazine’s editor. “They have a hand they could easily make worse by panicking, and which could be good enough for a win or draw if they keep calm.” <br><br> The Republicans are getting the worst of this right now, based on public opinion polls. This is clearly a concern of some Republicans, including Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), who have called the House GOP strategy a dead-end approach. But while the GOP’s vulnerabilities are likely to intensify the longer the situation remains unresolved, for now they are being reinforced by the base. <br><br> Democrats recognize that the longer the fight continues with government services disrupted, the more voters could hold them at least partly responsible as participants in a dysfunctional government. They said they were doing everything they could Tuesday to avoid what Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.) called a “pox on all their houses.” <br><br> Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, was trying to convince those in the public who haven’t taken sides that the fault lies entirely with the Republicans. <br><br> Whether that argument will hold in the face of an indefinite standoff that tries the public’s patience is another question. The best that Obama and the Democrats can say to themselves is that they enter this moment less weak than their Republican adversaries. The president’s approval ratings are tepid — somewhere in the mid-40s — but they didn’t take a serious tumble as the shutdown battle intensified. <br><br> Congressional Democrats are held in even lower esteem than Obama, which is always the case, but they are still higher than congressional Republicans. However, the longer the stalemate continues, the more nervous their side is likely to be. <br><br> Still, the Republicans continue to be at greater political risk because they are being defined by a rebellious faction in the House. That has produced angst among some Republican commentators about the strategy advocated by the tea party movement in the House and accepted by Boehner. But do those views indicate a wider nervousness inside the party — or a deep divide between GOP elites and rank-and-file followers of the tea party? <br><br> Whatever the case, it will take something more to change the party’s image. In the late 1990s, House Republicans were the face of the GOP and considered too rebellious and hard-edged (although less so than they are today). It took the emergence of then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush as a presidential candidate, offering himself as a compassionate conservative, to begin to redefine the party. <br><br> Bush was bolstered by support among Republican governors, who consolidated around him early as their choice to lead the party in the 2000 presidential race. No Republican today appears to have the name, national prominence, political network or solid base to do what Bush was able to do then. <br><br> Political battles like these generally end when one side concludes that the damage has become too severe. Sometimes that occurs after an election beating, but the midterm contest is more than a year away. Similarly, a sharp turn in public opinion could cause the kind of panicking in the ranks that Kristol warned against. As of Tuesday, neither side seemed to think it had reached that point. <br><br>",01/10/2013,14:22:00,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/01/National-Politics/Images/Was7959674.jpg,House Speaker John Boehner speaks to the media at the Capitol on Oct. 1.

We're a little skeptical. <br><br> Want proof? According to a new Pew Research Center poll of voter attitudes, 69 percent of people would like to see most members of Congress sent packing in the 2014 election. That's up 13 points since the last midterm in 2010. And ... wow. <br><br> When it comes to their own members, though, only 36 percent say the same. That's up just two points from four years ago and not much higher than in 2006. Clearly, people aren't lining up to toss their baby out with the bathwater. <br><br> Of course, it's well-established that people's aversion to Congress often doesn't extend to their own member of it. After all, my guy/gal isn't part of the problem; it's those other losers. Which a big reason more than 90 percent of incumbents -- and often much more -- get reelected. <br><br> That's one reason. The other big reason is that many Americans' default is simply to hit the ""reelect"" button. And it's actually a strikingly bipartisan/nonpartisan impulse. <br><br> Witness the below chart. As expected, Republican voters in GOP-held districts and Democratic voters in Democratic districts say their member deserves reelection. <br><br> What's fascinating, though, is that nearly half (47 percent) of Democrats in GOP districts say the same. And so do 34 percent of Republicans in Democratic districts. I.e. it's not just partisans and some politically casual independents who are defending their own member; it's a lot of their constituents from across the aisle. <br><br> Those numbers seem quite high for an American electorate that is supposed to be so polarized. <br><br> Maybe their connection to their own member is just that strong. Or maybe they have no idea which party their member of Congress belongs to (the poll shows only slightly more than half of Americans can correctly answer this question). <br><br> Either way, it's pretty clear that, however much Americans hate Congress, they're hair-trigger response, when in doubt, is to vote for two/six more years. <br><br> Which is a big reason why Congress won't be truly overhauled any time soon. <br><br>",24/07/2014,11:16:15,https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2014/06/ballot-box1.jpg,"A woman casts her 2012 ballot at a voting booth in a gymnasium at the Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades, Calif.

2,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/27/democrats-have-a-depth-problem/,Democrats have a depth problem,Aaron Blake,blog,Politics,The Fix,"The implosion of Ed FitzGerald's gubernatorial campaign is painful for Ohio Democrats because he was supposed to be their Next Big Thing. <br><br> It's particularly devastating, though, because he's basically all they had. Behind him, the cupboard is pretty bare when it comes to recruiting capable Democrats into big-time statewide campaigns. <br><br> But how is that possible? How could Ohio, one of the nation's premier swing states and a political mecca if there ever was one, have such a thin Democratic bench? <br><br> It's actually pretty simple: They have very little farm system (to borrow a baseball term). And that's because Republicans, as they have done in several key states, have taken it away from them. <br><br> As I noted Tuesday, Ohio Democrats control just one-quarter of the state's 16 congressional seats, less than one-third of the state Senate, less than 40 percent of the state House and none of the state's five statewide constitutional offices. None of these numbers are coincidences. Republicans snapped up a lot of territory in the 2010 wave election and gave themselves the right to redraw Ohio's congressional, state House and state Senate maps. The gerrymandering that ensued made it very hard for Democrats to compete on any of these maps for the next decade. <br><br> It's not hard to follow the logic from there. A GOP-friendly map = fewer Democrats = a much smaller Democratic farm system. The fact that Democrats have just four members of the U.S. House -- to the GOP's 12 -- and none of the five statewide constitutional officers means they don't have many obvious recruits-in-waiting for Senate or governor. (These are the positions, after all, that tend to take that next step. About 75 percent of the non-incumbents running in key Senate races come from these two recruiting bays.) <br><br> And when it comes to recruiting for Congress and these statewide offices, Democrats have problems there, too. The fact that there are five GOP state legislators for every three Democrats means Republicans have a massively bigger pool of potential recruits to pull from for those more intermediate statewide offices and congressional seats. It's a problem that really runs from the statehouse up. <br><br> Unfortunately for Democrats, it's not a problem just in Ohio. This is an emerging issue for them in as many as eight key swing and blue-leaning states which comprise basically one-fourth of the American political map. <br><br> In these eight states -- Florida, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin -- the average percentage of Democrats is: <br><br> 31 percent in their congressional delegations <br><br> 39 percent in their state Houses <br><br> 37 percent in their state Senates <br><br> 38 percent in their statewide constitutional offices <br><br> That's right, across these eight states -- seven of which President Obama won in 2008 and six of which he carried in 2012 -- Democrats can't crack 40 percent in any of the key farm systems. They don't even control a state House or state Senate in one of them. <br><br> Here's the percentage of Democrats in each category, state by state: <br><br> As bad as these numbers look for Democrats, they are compounded by a couple of things: <br><br> 1) There really isn't an inverse in which Democrats have decimated the GOP bench in a swing state. <br><br> 2) It's not just the few seats Democrats controls; it's the type of seats they control. <br><br> The name of the game in redistricting, after all, is to pack your opponents into as few districts as possible, while making all the other districts lean toward your side (ideally enough so that the incumbent won't be in serious danger). <br><br> The practical effect of that is that Republicans in these states have created a lot of very homogeneous Democratic districts and a lot of marginally Republican districts in which the incumbents are probably safe but still has to mind their Ps and Qs. <br><br> Here's what that looks like in Florida, using the Cook Political Report's Partisan Voting Index (PVI): <br><br> So while 11 Florida districts lean Republican by seven or fewer points, just one Democratic-leaning district is even remotely competitive. <br><br> Want to guess which kind of district is more likely to produce a credible candidate for statewide office? Hint: It's not the district where the incumbent only has to impress his or her heavily liberal constituents. <br><br> And it's not just Florida. In Ohio, none of the four districts held by Democrats went less than 63 percent for Obama in 2012. In Pennsylvania, only one of the five Democratic-held districts went less than 2-to-1 for the president. And in North Carolina, none of the three Democratic-leaning congressional seats that Republicans drew gave Obama less than 70 percent of the vote two years ago. <br><br> It's a recipe for long-term recruiting problems for Democrats. And we're seeing that in stark relief in Ohio. <br><br>",27/08/2014,13:16:05,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/early-lead/Images/2014-06-16T040150Z_01_SAN85_RTRIDSP_3_NBA-FINALS-049.jpg,"This is not the Democrats' bench.

Give politicians some power and a job to get done, and they quickly forget their righteous critiques of the seamy practices they denounced when the other side was running things. <br><br> Rarely, however, has the double standard been so flagrant as now, when Republicans are scrambling to keep their promise to “repeal and replace Obamacare.” <br><br> Exhibit A: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is set to produce a draft of a bill to be voted on next week. <br><br> Back when the Affordable Care Act passed on a party-line vote in 2010, the then-minority leader was full-throated in his denunciation of “the partisan route” that majority Democrats had taken and of the “closed-door sweetheart deals that were made to gain the slimmest margin for passage of a bill that’s about their health care.” <br><br> If Republicans got back in control, McConnell vowed in 2014, “there’s not a chance” they would act as Democrats did. <br><br> But that earlier process — which also included many months of committee hearings and bipartisan negotiation — was as transparent as a fish tank compared with the drafting of a health-care bill that is taking place privately in McConnell’s office, largely with a small cadre of aides. The leader himself has acknowledged it is a “Republicans-only exercise.” <br><br> Senate GOP leaders argue that they have held more than a dozen closed-door listening sessions in which members have had the chance to learn about policy options and share their opinions. But members and staff say privately that those conversations haven’t included any specific details of what leaders plan to put in a final bill. <br><br> Many in McConnell’s own party are grumbling publicly. <br><br> “I would like a more open process. That’s for sure,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who added that she cannot commit to a position on the legislation because she has no idea what is in it. <br><br> “We used to complain like hell when the Democrats ran the Affordable Care Act. Now, we’re doing the same thing,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). <br><br> McConnell, however, is far from the only Republican who seems to suffer from a sudden case of amnesia. <br><br> Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has expressed no qualms about the way Republicans are putting together their bill on Capitol Hill. <br><br> But back on Jan. 14, 2010, when he was a Republican congressman from Georgia, Price tweeted: “With Democrats discussing health care in secret, they’re sacrificing the trust of the American people.” <br><br> That moment seven years ago was a critical one for Democrats. As they realized that a special-election defeat in Massachusetts could cost them their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, their leaders were scrambling for a backup plan. <br><br> In the end, Democrats got their bill, but the legislative maneuvering it took to get it over the finish line was not pretty. <br><br> There had been special deals for individual senators that became known as the “Cornhusker Kickback” and the “Louisiana Purchase.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) made an infamous declaration that spawned a legion of attack ads: “We have to pass the bill to find out what’s in it.” <br><br> As the House prepared to pass the health-care legislation, then-Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) thundered from the well of the chamber: “Look at how this bill was written! Can you say it was done openly, with transparency and accountability, without backroom deals struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell no you can’t!” <br><br> “Have you read the bill?” he added. “. . . Hell no you haven’t!” <br><br> Indeed, “Read the bill, read the bill” was a frequently heard chant at tea party rallies before the passage of the Affordable Care Act. <br><br> But when the Republican-led House passed its own version of the latest health-care bill in May, many who voted for it acknowledged that they were not all that familiar with what was in their legislation that affects one-sixth of the U.S. economy — though it was a mere 137 pages, compared with more than 2,000 in the ACA. <br><br> “Oh, gosh!” Rep. Thomas Garrett (R-Va.) said in an interview with MSNBC. “Let’s put it this way: People in my office have read all the parts of the bill. I don’t think any individual has read the whole bill. That’s why we have staff.” <br><br> Beyond the awkwardness of having to eat their own words, however, Republicans could face real danger in doing things this way on an issue such as health care, which touches the life of every American. <br><br> “We all know that hypocrisy is a co-pilot in Washington,” said John Weaver, a Republican political strategist. “But we’re not talking about some provision in the tax code that impacts billionaires, or an esoteric trade policy that only affects Vietnam.” <br><br> “If they think they can keep a bad bill secret until the last minute and it will change their fortunes, that’s crazy,” Weaver added. “It won’t be sustainable, and it will be one of the leading reasons we could lose seats in Congress next year, and maybe the White House” in 2020. <br><br> On Tuesday, a clearly frustrated McConnell called Democratic complaints about the secretive process “laughable” and “irrelevant.” The majority leader promised that lawmakers will be given adequate time to review the final bill, but added that Democrats have made clear that they are not interested in making any major changes to Obamacare. <br><br> “I think this will be about as transparent as it can be,” McConnell said. “No transparency would be added by having hearings in which Democrats offered endless single-payer system amendments. That is not what this Republican Senate was sent here to do.” <br><br> It also may be that McConnell simply is out of options, short of surrendering on what has been the Republicans’ signature promise in every election since 2010. <br><br> “There must be no other way, because McConnell always has a plan,” said Ed Rogers, a lobbyist and veteran Republican strategist. “He has carefully assessed all other ways to proceed, and this is the best one. The Republican universe will adapt.” <br><br> Kelsey Snell contributed to this report. <br><br>",21/06/2017,13:09:09,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/06/21/Others/Images/2017-06-20/mcconnell_3.jpg,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) answers questions concerning health-care legislation on Capitol Hill Tuesday.
